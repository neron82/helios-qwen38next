# Helios status — GLM-5.3-Flash-exl3 inference engine (2× RTX 3090, 128 GB DDR4)

## Round 2 verdicts (all measured; the details are in the sections below)

| deliverable | verdict | decisive evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **cross-request prefix caching** | **implemented, `HELIOS_PREFIX_CACHE=1`, default OFF** | GDN + PLE recurrent state snapshotted at prefill chunk boundaries into pinned host RAM; 5.2k shared prefix **24.7x** (5511 -> 219 ms), 8k **5.5x**; reused output **byte-identical** to a full prefill with MTP off *and* on, +1.7% on a cold prefill that gets no reuse (RESULTS.md) |
| **KV compression (q8_0)** | **no-go — but the context it was meant to buy was already there** | the same VRAM came back for free (cap 262144 -> 540000, +106%, no compute cost); q8_0 would add +74% more, cannot speed anything up (the sparse decode is issue-bound), cannot help expert residency at all (card topology), and its attention error (1.96e-04) is *below* the engine's own fp16 kernel noise |
| **trellis decode in `exl3_moe_kernel`** | **no-go — the kernel is already at the shape's ceiling** | at the real per-expert shape (M=227, N=2048, K=4096) **cuBLAS fp16 without any trellis decode reaches only 44.9 TFLOPS**, while the fused kernel does gather + trellis decode + Hadamard + activation + scatter at **38** — i.e. inside ~18% of a decode-free ceiling |
| **MTP speculative decoding** | **no-go — it is slower, and the old "+5.8%" was a metric artifact** | 120 tokens: 16.8 s off vs 20.6 s (k=1) and 29.2 s (k=3) — **26% and 57% slower**; the draft's KV cache was never written (measured all-zero) and filling it improves draft *rank* quality but not the accept rate, whose ceiling is the head's own sharpness (top-1 36%) |

### KV/context: what the VRAM was actually being spent on

At cap 262144 the KV cache was only ~4.4 GB of GPU0's footprint; the rest of the *cache* side was
three buffers sized for a job they did not do. Reclaiming them is free (no kernel changes, no
precision loss) and it is worth more than q8_0 would have been:

| change | saved | effect |
|---|---|---|
| indexer raw rows: per-token plane -> ring of (max_chunk + 4) rows | 1.43 GB | |
| indexer score matrix: max_chunk rows -> the 1024 rows actually in flight | 0.94 GB | |
| scalar indexer's transposed pool plane (a fallback the engine never takes) | 0.18 GB | |
| **measured result** | **kv 4.44 -> 3.10 GB** | GPU0 free 1.60 -> 3.97 GB at cap 262144 |

That is context, directly: **cap 262144 -> 540000** with 0.74 GB of headroom left, verified by running
a 97,039-token prompt at **349.9 tok/s — the same rate as at the old cap**. Over 600000 also fits but
leaves ~50 MB free, which is too tight to ship.

Why q8_0 would be the wrong way to buy the next increment:
* **It cannot make anything faster.** The sparse decode is issue-bound (a bit-exact row-blocked
  variant that cut its traffic 8x measured neutral), so halving bytes buys nothing; its cost is purely
  the dequantisation ALU.
* **It cannot help expert residency at all**, which was the other axis to compare against. The KV
  lives on GPU0 and the expert pool on GPU1, and GPU0's VRAM is worthless for experts: its PCIe link
  measures 2.85 GB/s against 25 GB/s from the RAM arena, so an expert tier on GPU0 would stream ~9x
  slower than the tier below it. For the record, the freed 1.4-3 GB *would* be worth roughly +7.5-16%
  residency (about +4-9% decode) if it were fungible, which it is not.
* **The quality question is settled and favourable, but it is the only favourable part.** On 1939 real
  `ckv` rows dumped from the engine, block-wise int8 (q8_0) gives a relative attention-output error of
  **1.96e-04**, against the engine's own fp16 kernel deviations of 1.7-2.8e-04 — i.e. invisible next to
  rounding the engine already does. fp8 is 10x worse (2.5e-03) and 4-bit 60x worse (1.2e-02), so if a
  compressed cache is ever wanted, 8 bits is the only defensible choice.

So the honest reading of the tradeoff: the same VRAM was reclaimed for free, q8_0's marginal +74% of
context costs a real per-element dequantisation in an issue-bound kernel, and nothing in the engine
gets faster. It is documented here as available-if-needed rather than implemented. (If context beyond
~540k is ever wanted, note that the same bytes also buy a *larger prefill chunk*, which is worth ~22%
of MoE efficiency at these shapes — see the trellis section — so the VRAM has three competing uses,
not two.)

### Trellis decode: the kernel is shape-bound, not decode-bound

`exl3_moe_kernel` is ~3.6 s per 8192-token chunk (25% of prefill) at 38 TFLOPS, 54% of the card's
spec fp16 peak — which reads like a 46% headroom inside the kernel. It is not. Measured ceiling at the
shapes the kernel actually processes (`/tmp/moe_ceiling.py`, cuBLAS fp16, *no* trellis decode):

| shape | M=16 | M=64 | **M=227** (real per-expert rows) | M=512 | M=8192 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gate/up (K=4096, N=2048) | 6.0 | 33.3 | **44.9** | 47.7 | 64.9 TFLOPS |
| down (K=2048, N=4096) | 10.5 | 40.8 | **50.3** | 54.2 | 69.4 TFLOPS |

A decode-free fp16 GEMM at the same per-expert shape reaches 44.9 TFLOPS and does *nothing else*; the
fused kernel does the gather, the 2-bit trellis decode, the Hadamard transforms, the activation and the
scatter, and reaches 38. The gap to the *true* ceiling is therefore ~18%, and most of what looked like
headroom is the shape: the same GEMM at M=8192 reaches 64.9 TFLOPS, so the grouped/skinny structure
costs ~30% before any decode is involved. Removing per-expert barriers or restructuring the ticket
scheduler cannot recover that. (Measured bound on the second half: the ticket schedule *was* worth
something - deterministic LPT ordering instead of scan-order round-robin took the prefill MoE phase
843 -> 800 ms, -5.3%, bit-identical output - which is consistent with this section: 5% of a 30%
structural cost, not the cost itself. See RESULTS.md.)

This also explains why batching does not amortise the MoE (the premise MTP needs): a 4-row verify costs
**11.5 ms of MoE per layer against 1.7 ms for a single decode step** — 6.8x for 4 rows, superlinear,
because each additional row activates a different expert set and each slab carries its own fixed cost.

### MTP: root-caused, fixed, and still not worth it

Root cause of the low accept rate, measured rather than argued (`HELIOS_MTP_STATS=1`):

* **The draft layer's KV cache was never written.** Its first 16 rows and the rows next to the current
  position measured rms 0.00000, nonzero 0/8192, while the trunk's were rms 0.42, nonzero 8192/8192.
  The draft attention therefore attended over zeros and contributed nothing; `mtp_step` only advances
  that cache for *generated* tokens, so the whole prompt was missing.
* Fixed: `mtp_prefill` runs the draft block over each prefill chunk while the chunk's tokens and
  collapsed states are still live (embed + hnorm/enorm + eh_proj + input_ln + MLA only; no MoE, no
  head). Verified: the draft's rows are now populated (rms 0.73, 8192/8192 nonzero).
* It **improves the draft** — the trunk's token is inside the draft's top-8 63% of the time, up from
  41% — but **not the accept rate**, because the head's top-1 rate is ~36% either way. That is the
  model's head, not the plumbing.

The economics, measured on wall clock for identical emitted output (`--tokens 120`, greedy, same
prompt; prefill time subtracted using its own measured rate):

| config | wall | prefill | decode wall | emitted rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MTP off | 16.81 s | 7.7 s | 9.1 s | **13.2 tok/s** |
| MTP k=1 | 20.61 s | 8.3 s | 12.3 s | 9.8 tok/s (-26%) |
| MTP k=3 | 29.22 s | 8.3 s | 20.9 s | 5.7 tok/s (-57%) |
| MTP k=0 (loop, no drafting) | 10.83 s | — | — | 13.2 tok/s (no loop cost) |

The engine's own `decode tok/s` reports 14.80 for the k=3 case because `tm_.decode_tokens` counts
*verified rows*, not emitted tokens — a 2.6x inflation that matches the 2.75 rows per emitted token.
That is the source of the "+5.8% decode" recorded earlier in this file, and it is corrected here.
Break-even would need an average of ~2.2 accepted drafts per round (a ~73% accept rate) against the
measured 0.67, and no acceptance rule fixes that when the marginal verified row costs ~1.7x a
standalone decode row.


## Cross-request prefix caching: implemented and measured

> **This section describes the KDA engine (`helios`), not this one.** On helios-qwen the KV cache is
> position-addressed in the same way, but the recurrent state is **GDN** (36 layers: a conv window
> and a recurrent matrix each) plus the **PLE's** dilated conv and host n-gram window, there is no

> output-identity table and the limits are in RESULTS.md, section "Cross-request prefix cache".

Every request used to prefill from token 0, so a chat client that re-sends its history paid for the
whole history on every turn. The cache planes are position-addressed and were already being left in
place between requests; what was missing was (a) knowing which tokens they hold and (b) a way to wind
the KDA recurrence back to a position, since that state - a conv window plus a recurrent matrix per
KDA layer - is a function of the whole prefix rather than of a position.

Design, in `Runner`/`prefix.hpp`:
* `hist_` is the token sequence the planes hold; `pos_` is how much of it is computed. Both are
  maintained by `prefill`/`decode`, and every cache read is already bounded by the query position, so
  rows past `pos_` may hold anything without being read.
* `prefix_plan` (pure function, no GPU) compares the prompt with `hist_` and returns one of three
  modes: **extension** (the prompt continues the history - the planes and the KDA state already hold
  it, so nothing is restored and nothing is recomputed), **snapshot** (divergence: restore the newest
  KDA snapshot at or below it, then recompute from there), **restart** (too little shared, or no
  snapshot that old: a normal full prefill). The prompt's last token is always re-run, since the
  caller samples from it.
* Snapshots: the whole model's KDA state is 142.4 MB (34 layers). A ring of them lives in **pinned
  host memory**, not VRAM, because VRAM is exactly what context length competes for. Capture is one
  D2D copy (0.3 ms, compute stream) plus an asynchronous copy to the host, so it is off the critical
  path; a restore is ~50 ms over GPU0's x4 link, once per divergent request. Default 4 GB = 28
  snapshots at an 8192-token interval, i.e. ~229k tokens of reusable history. The last chunk of a
  prompt stops one token short so that the state a *re-sent* request resumes from is captured too.

Measured through the server (`/tmp/prefix_e2e.py`), a 15k-token document with a passphrase planted in
the reused region - retrieving it is the correctness signal, since a cache that served the wrong rows
(or restored the wrong KDA state) could not answer from it:

| request | prompt tokens | wall | speedup | logged decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cold prefill | 14,960 | 44.3 s | — | `resident=0 common=0 extension -> resume=0` |
| re-sent identically | 14,960 | **1.3 s** | **33.6x** | `resident=14959 common=14960 snapshot -> resume=14959` |
| next chat turn | 14,994 | **4.8 s** | **9.2x** | `resident=14973 common=14973 extension -> resume=14973` |
| diverge mid-history | 13,473 | 18.0 s | 2.2x | `resident=8192 common=13447 snapshot -> resume=8192` |

All four retrieved the passphrase. A separate run at 21k tokens: 61.7 s cold -> 1.3 s re-sent (46.9x)
-> 4.7 s next turn, all three passing. The mid-history case resumes at the 8192 snapshot because the
divergence (~13.4k) is below the 14959 snapshot; PASS2 was planted at ~10k, i.e. behind the resume
point, so recovering it depends on the restored state rather than the recomputed span.

Verified also that the engine is unaffected when reuse is unavailable: a 79,529-token prompt with
snapshots active ran clean (227.5 s, passphrase retrieved), and a 13,476-token unrelated prompt
correctly logged `common=10 restart`.

`/metrics` gained `prefix_reused_tokens`, `prefix_last_resume`, `prefix_snapshots`,
`prefix_snapshot_interval`; `HELIOS_PREFIX_DEBUG` logs each decision. `src/engine/test_prefix.cpp`
(42 checks, no GPU) pins the policy: extension/regenerate/divergence-at-a-snapshot/divergence-below-
every-snapshot/no-snapshots/prefix-of-history/unrelated/one-token prompts.

## Bug found while mapping the cache: pools completed during decode were never written

`kpool_write` had the guard `if (t0 < pos_start || t0 + POOL - 1 >= pos_start + n_new) return;` - a
pool was only computed if *all four* of its tokens were written by the current call. During decode
one token is written per call, so **every pool that completed during decode was never written at
all**, while the indexer's visibility rule (`p*POOL + POOL - 1 <= q_pos`) still exposed it: after G
generated tokens, ~G/4 pools were readable garbage, i.e. 4 wrong keys out of ~2052 gathered per
query. Silent (0.2% of attention) which is why it survived the quality gates.

Fixed by requiring only the *last* member to be in the call: the raw rows of the earlier members are
still in the plane, and they belong to the same sequence (a chunk boundary, or now a prefix-cache
resume). New parity case `kpool_write split invariance` compares the same 16 tokens written in one
call, in 4-token calls and in 1-token calls: **0/512 differ either way, 0 unwritten** (the 1-token
path is 0/512 unwritten only after the fix). All suites pass: attn parity ALL PASS, aux PASS, gemm
smoke OK, prefix 42/42, tokenizer 28/28, utf8 PASS.


## Deliverable state (current build - see the log below for how it got here)

A running engine that serves GLM-5.3-Flash-exl3 (2.05 bpw) at 250k context:

| metric | campaign start | **current** | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 250k prefill+decode | ~48 min (86.5 tok/s) | **711.60 s (346.3 tok/s prefill)** | `helios gen --cap 262144 --tokens 6` on a 246,193-token prompt |
| decode @246k | 8.29 tok/s | **17.82 tok/s** | same run |
| decode @32k | 11.40 tok/s | **18.29 tok/s** | 40-token run |
| needle @26.6k | - | **PASS** ('ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471', 78 s) | chat-templated, via `helios serve` |

- `helios gen` / `helios serve` produce coherent output; HTTP (`/health`, `/v1/models`,
  `/v1/completions`, `/v1/chat/completions` incl. SSE, `/metrics`) verified with curl.
- **Cross-request prefix caching is in** (see the section below): a re-sent prompt answers in 1.3 s
  instead of 44 s (33.6x), the next chat turn in 4.8 s (9.2x), with KDA-state snapshots in pinned host
  RAM so the feature costs no VRAM.
- `--cap 262144` allocates `[cache] cap=262144 tokens mla=11 kda=34 kv=4.44GB total=6.81GB maxM=8192`
  (11 MLA layers of 512-wide fp16 latents + 34 KDA recurrent states + indexer pool planes), plus a
  3053-slot expert pool (17.99 GB, 6.035 MB/slab) on GPU1 fed from a 73 GB pinned RAM arena.
- Suite status: attn parity, aux parity, gemm smoke, reconstruct and tokenizer 28/28 all pass.
- The document below is a **chronological log**: several early sections are superseded, and the
  "Retracted measurements" section records conclusions that later proved wrong (MTP, the copy-path
  ceiling, residency ranking). Trust the tables in this header and the newest sections.

## Long-context evidence (all runs at `--cap 262144`)
| prompt tokens | chunk | result |
|---|---|---|
| 573 | 512 | prefill 66.9 tok/s, decode 9.31 |
| 8,316 | 2048 | prefill 86.4 tok/s, decode 8.42 |
| 9,613 | 512 | prefill 85.7 tok/s, decode 8.33 |
| 26,902 | 512 | prefill 70.4 tok/s, decode 7.85–8.05 (repeated clean runs) |
| 196,608 | 2048 | reached this position before the run was cut (55-86 tok/s throughout, ~1:26 of its own clock) |
Decode stays ~8 tok/s after a long prompt: the pool-based sparse attention is O(1)-ish in context,
so long-context decode is not the bottleneck — prefill is.

## Long-context *content* verification (needle in a haystack)
`/tmp/needle10k.txt`: "Remember this passphrase: ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471." followed by ~8.9k tokens of
filler and a question about it. At `--cap 262144 --chunk 2048` the engine answered
**"The user asked me to remember a passphrase at the start: ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471"** at 85.2 tok/s
prefill / 8.18 tok/s decode. The sparse pool+top-k path selects from 2235 pools at that length, so
this is direct end-to-end evidence that long-context retrieval through the ordered/sparse
attention works — the one correctness question that the ≤4-token oracles could not answer.

## Residency: measured ceiling, and why hot-set ranking is not worth it
Request skew over an 8.9k-token prompt (`[skew]` line, printed at exit):
`distinct=10709 requests=47914 | top-K share: 10%:20% 25%:39% 50%:67%`.
The top 25% of (layer, expert) keys — roughly what a 2754-slot pool can hold — cover only 39% of
requests, and the existing LFU+pin policy already reaches **38.9%** residency on the same workload
(verified). So the achievable gain from smarter ranking is ~1.0x: implemented a top-K hot-set
pinning policy, measured it (A/B: 8.39 vs 8.33 tok/s, 38.9% residency both, 710.8 vs 712.3GB H2D),
and removed the code. The `[skew]` probe is kept because it answers this question for any workload.

## Numerical verification (current build, torch references from the checkpoint)
Reproduce (details under "Reproduction"): layer-0 KDA oracle, layer-3 MLA oracle, layer-3 MoE
oracle, plus the unit suites.
| stage | correlation |
|---|---|
| layer 0 KDA sublayer (conv+SiLU → delta rule → gated norm → o_proj) | **1.0000** (attn_out rel 0.005) |
| layer 3 MLA (attn, ckv, q_nope, q_lat, lat_out) | **1.0000** |
| layer 3 MoE (shared + routed) | **1.0000** (shared alone 0.561, routed alone 0.852 → the sum is exact) |
| tokenizer 28/28, glue GEMM, standalone fused MoE, aux parity | all pass |
`block0_oracle.py` still disagrees (normed input corr 0.04) but its reference chain is stale: the KDA
oracle consumes the same `.in` file as its *input* and reproduces the engine's output at 1.0000, so
`.in` is what the engine actually used and the divergence is in that oracle's embed→hc_mix→norm
re-derivation, not in the engine.

## Bugs found and fixed (all verified by re-test)
1. Loader never enqueued the embedding-table transfer (zero hidden states).
2. `final_head` normalised row 0 instead of the last token of the chunk.
3. Per-layer input/post norms were missing (`hc.mix -> norm -> sublayer`).
4. `glue::gemm_nt_f16` loaded the weight tile transposed.
5. KDA short conv must apply SiLU.
6. `SlotMgr` was keyed with the arena slot-base instead of the layer index (OOB read → segfault).
7. Device discipline (`DevGuard`, per-call `cudaSetDevice`).
8. `exl3::gemm`/`moe_grouped` launch fallbacks and `cudaFuncSetAttribute` per call.
9. Fused MoE picked the mcg codebook path for mul1 experts (`[N_off]` vs `[2*cb_idx + N_off]`);
   fixing it took layer-3 MoE from corr −0.003 to 1.0000.
10. **Null expert pointers in the fused MoE** (this phase): `SlotMgr::acquire` was driven by the
    host-side D2H of `w1.topk_i64`, which under-reports the expert set relative to the device-side
    `w1.ec` counts the kernel schedules from. Experts the kernel touched but the host never acquired
    got a null table entry and `moe_grouped` dereferences entries unconditionally → illegal access
    surfacing at whatever sync came next (hence the moving error lines and contradictory bisects).
    Fixed: acquire loop driven by `w1.ec` (readback folded into the existing s1 sync), `acquire`
    drains in-flight copies and retries then force-unpins before ever failing, and `moe_ffn`
    verifies its resident set and aborts loudly instead of launching over null pointers.
11. **Cache/Runner workspace mismatch**: `Cache` sized its per-batch buffers at a hardcoded
    `maxM=512` while the Runner sized from `--chunk`, so any chunk > 512 made the MoE input D2H read
    past `c_->xf` ("invalid argument"). `Cache::init(m, cap, max_chunk)`; chunk 2048 now works.
12. `Runner::prefill` could run past the configured capacity and index the position-addressed caches
    out of bounds; it now truncates with a warning.

## Copy path: resolved (the earlier "2.79GB/s ceiling" measured the wrong card)
Corrected benchmark `/tmp/copybench.cu` (4000 x 6.04MB reads out of a 23.6GB materialised
`cudaHostAlloc` buffer, 512 distinct destinations, depths 8/64/512/4000, scattered and sequential):
| device | pci | throughput |
|---|---|---|
| GPU0 (0000:07) | x4 | 2.85 GB/s |
| GPU1 (0000:2b) | x16 | **25.16 GB/s** |
Every depth and both orders give the same number on each card, so the copy path runs at the link
rate and the expert pool (GPU1) has full bandwidth available. An earlier note in this file claimed a
2.79GB/s platform ceiling: that was GPU0, the x4 card, and is retracted.

## Where prefill time actually goes
A 2048-token batch takes ~24s over 45 layers (~533ms/layer). Such a batch needs essentially all 288
experts of every sparse layer — 1.74GB per layer — which at the measured 25.16GB/s costs only ~70ms.
The remaining ~460ms/layer is the fused MoE itself (~1.5-2 TFLOPS of useful 2-bit work at ~57
rows/expert). The forced-shape sweep (shapes 2/3/4 -> 84.1/83.3/80.1 tok/s) shows the port's default
kernel choice is already the best available instance. Prefill is MoE-compute-bound, not I/O-bound.

## Retracted measurements
- "MTP speculative decoding will give 2-3x": first measured as not paying off. Marginal expert
  streaming is ~1.1-1.2GB per token and *invariant to batch size* (K=1/2/4/8 -> +1.32/+2.13/+4.73GB
  for +1/+3/+7 tokens), so verifying K drafts costs K times the bytes of decoding K tokens.
  **PARTIALLY REFUTED LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN**: MTP was implemented anyway, and the byte argument,
  while correct, was not the whole story - the profile shows decode's MoE runs at 0.95 TFLOPS and
  114GB/s, i.e. occupancy-bound rather than byte-bound, so batching k+1 tokens does amortize the
  fixed per-weight cost. Measured outcome: **+5.8% decode** (19.35 vs 18.29 tok/s at 32k) at a 15-22%
  accept rate, correctness verified token-identical. The original reasoning was not wrong about
  bytes; it just missed that M=1 decode is not byte-bound. Final status: implemented, opt-in, modest.


## Production server (final feature)
`helios serve <model> --cap 262144 --chunk 512 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8099 [--api-key KEY]`

OpenAI-compatible surface, verified end to end with curl (including from the LAN address
192.168.2.201:8099, i.e. reachable by outside applications):
| endpoint | notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /health`, `GET /v1/models`, `GET /metrics` | liveness, model list, engine timings |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | system/user/assistant/tool messages, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `stop`, `n=1`, streaming |
| `POST /v1/completions` | raw text completion |

Agent-relevant behaviour, all verified against the live server:
- **Thinking split**: the generation prompt opens `<​think>`, so the server streams the model's
  reasoning as `delta.reasoning_content` and the answer as `delta.content` (non-streaming:
  `message.reasoning_content` / `message.content`). 70 reasoning chunks observed for a 70-token
  thinking run.
- **`enable_thinking: false`** (also `thinking`, `chat_template_kwargs.*`) renders a *closed* empty
  think block, which is exactly how historical assistant turns are rendered; the model then answers
  directly: `"Name the largest planet in our solar system. One word."` -> `content: "Jupiter"`,
  `finish_reason: stop`.
- **Tool calls**: `tools` are rendered into the model's `<tools>` block and `<tool_call>` output is
  parsed back into OpenAI `tool_calls` (`id`, `type: function`, `name`, JSON `arguments`), with
  `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. A `role: tool` result renders as `<|observation|><tool_response>`
  and the model then answers from it ("The weather in Paris right now is **18°C** with **partly
  cloudy** conditions." from a tool result of `{"temp_c": 18, "conditions": "partly cloudy"}`).
- **Turn-boundary stopping**: `<|user|>`/`<|assistant|>`/`<|system|>` end generation, so clients get
  the answer instead of hallucinated conversation turns.
- Streaming emits a `role` chunk first, then deltas, then a `finish_reason` chunk, optional usage
  (`stream_options.include_usage`) and `[DONE]`; a disconnecting client cancels its generation.
- One generation at a time (single-sequence engine): the request lock is held for the whole
  generation including streaming; httplib still serves other connections.

Template fidelity: `src/core/chat.cpp` reproduces `chat_template.jinja` **byte-for-byte** for plain
chat, tools, a tool-call round trip and multi-turn reasoning clearing, checked against
transformers' `apply_chat_template` (`/tmp/chat_parity.py`, PARITY PASS). The checkpoint closes its
thinking with `<​/think>` (token 154842) - verified against the tokenizer, not assumed.

## Engine fixes found by the server work
- **Slot reservation invariant**: `sync_copies()` released the `busy` flag of slots acquired earlier
  in the same step, so a later `acquire` could evict an expert the kernel was about to read; the
  fail-fast guard then fired (correctly) instead of the kernel faulting. `sync_copies` now keeps
  slots that are in `used_` reserved until `end_step`. After this fix a mixed battery of 600-token
  generations, multi-turn, tools and reasoning ran clean with no degradation events.
- **Graceful degradation**: if an expert still cannot be made resident, `force_resident()` evicts
  regardless of pinning; failing that, its table entry points at a zeroed slab so the kernel reads
  zeros (logged) instead of dereferencing a null pointer. Never triggered in testing.
- **Special tokens in output**: the tool-call XML tags are special tokens, and the tokenizer's
  `decode()` skipped them, so tool calls arrived as bare text. Added `decode(ids, keep_special)` and
  the server parses with specials kept (the parser strips them from client-visible text).
- `--api-key` (Bearer) and `--host 0.0.0.0` for external access; verified: no key -> 401, wrong key
  -> 401, correct key -> 200, `/health` left open for liveness probes.
- Currently running: `helios serve ~/models/glm53flash --cap 262144 --chunk 512 --host 0.0.0.0
  --port 8099` (reachable at http://192.168.2.201:8099), latest check
  `"Reply with exactly: server online"` -> `content: 'server online'`, `finish_reason: stop`.


## Prefill investigation (instrumentation added, root cause still open)
Prefill sits at ~86 tok/s and is not the deliverable's blocker, but it deserved a proper look because
the per-layer time (~530ms at a 2048-token batch) is far above the sum of its measured parts.
Instrumentation added (all behind `HELIOS_PROF`, zero cost when unset):
- `helios bench <model> [--max-m M]`: dense EXL3 gemm TFLOPS at MoE and MLA shapes, host time per
  `exl3::gemm` call, and (with `HELIOS_BENCH_ARENA=N`) the RAM-arena -> GPU1 copy rate.
- Event-based per-stage timers in `mla_layer` (no host syncs, so the numbers are not distorted) and
  host/event stage timers in `layer_step`; `HELIOS_PROF_EVERY` controls the MoE-phase print interval.
Measured facts:
| measurement | result |
|---|---|
| arena -> GPU1 copies (576 x 6.04MB) | 24.93 GB/s (0.254 ms/slab) - the copy path is fine |
| dense gemm, gate/up/down at m=64 | ~14.6 TFLOPS; at m=512 -> 15.2 |
| MLA projections at m=2048 | q_a 10.0, q_b **24.9**, kv_a 1.95, wq_b 16.8 TFLOPS |
| host time inside one `exl3::gemm` | 3.9 us/call - not launch-bound |
| per-stage, event-based, 2048-token batches | q_proj 7.3ms, kv 4.4, idx_proj 4.0, idx_score 57, sparse 99 **kpool_write 832**, **o_absorb 540** |
Interpretation: the gemms are not the cost (all of them together are ~15ms/layer). Two small kernels
account for ~1.37s of the ~1.56s attention time per layer: `kpool_write` (a 4-element loop per thread
over 128 channels, ~2048 blocks) and `o_absorb` (run as 256 launches of an 8-row kernel). Their
per-call cost is microseconds by inspection, so the windows are measuring something other than
kernel execution - a stall, or work attributed to the wrong stage.

Hypotheses tested and rejected this session:
- Not the copy path: 24.93 GB/s measured from the arena into GPU1 slots.
- Not the gemm shapes: forced-shape sweep showed the default instance choice is already best.
- Not host launch overhead: 3.9 us inside one `exl3::gemm` call, ~30 gemms per layer.
- Not blocking-stream serialisation: every stream is created with `cudaStreamNonBlocking`.
- Not the MoE kernel: replacing it with per-expert dense gemms (measured 14.6 TFLOPS standalone) made
  prefill *slower* (82.9 vs 86.5 tok/s), i.e. the MoE is not what prefill is waiting on.

**Resolved with a standalone probe** (`/tmp/attn_probe.cpp`, same shapes as the engine):
| kernel | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `kpool_write` (pos=6144, n=2048) | **0.005 ms/call** | the 832ms/layer attribution was a stall artifact, not execution |
| `o_absorb` x 256 launches (m=8, all rows) | **369 ms total, 1443 us per launch** | genuinely slow - and ~0.09 TFLOPS |

`o_absorb_k` read `kv_b` with a 1KB stride *between the 256 threads of a block* (thread t owns output
j=t and reads `kb[(h*512+256+t)*512 + c]`), i.e. fully uncoalesced - 32x the memory traffic. The
sibling kernel `q_latent` reads contiguously across threads, which is exactly why its loop measured
0ms while `o_absorb`'s measured 540ms.

Fix: build `w_uv^T[h][c][j]` once per MLA layer at init (`attn::wuv_transpose`, 16.8MB/layer on GPU0,
11 layers) and run a new `o_absorb_t` that reads the transposed weight contiguously across threads and
needs a *single* launch per layer instead of 256. **Prefill 86.5 -> 113.5 tok/s (+31%)**, decode
unchanged. Verified: MLA oracle corr 1.0000 (all five stages), KDA 1.0000, MoE ratios 1.000, attn
parity, tokenizer/chat/glue/aux suites all pass.

Remaining prefill suspects (in measured order): `mla_sparse_decode` 99ms/layer, `indexer_score`
57ms/layer, and the ~460ms/layer hand-off stall that `moe_ffn`'s GPU1 synchronisation lands in some
GPU0 stage window. The same audit - standalone probe per kernel - is the way to settle each.


## Prefill: 86.5 -> 238 tok/s (2.75x) from a per-kernel audit
The standalone-probe method (one probe per kernel, at the engine's real shapes) found three kernels
whose cost had nothing to do with their arithmetic:

| kernel | problem | before | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `o_absorb_k` | read `kv_b` with a 1KB stride between the 256 threads of a block (fully uncoalesced, 32x traffic); also launched 256x per layer for m<=8 rows | 256 launches, 369ms/layer | `w_uv^T` built once at init + `o_absorb_t`, one launch: **23ms/layer** |
| `indexer_score_k` | same class: for fixed `d`, 32 lanes read 256B apart (2B used per 32B transaction) | 57ms/layer | pool planes stored transposed `[c][pool]`: **5ms/layer** |
| `q_latent_k` | coalesced, but invoked in a 256-launch loop (m<=8 cap) - each launch ~1.4ms of latency | 256 launches/layer | `q_latent_t`, grid (rows, 64), 512 threads: **one launch** |
`kpool_write`'s 832ms/layer attribution turned out to be a stall artifact - the probe measured
0.005ms/call, and the window was where the `q_latent` loop's cost landed.

Measured effect (all at cap 262144, chunk 2048, 8316-token prompt):
- prefill 86.5 -> 113.5 (o_absorb) -> 117.0 (indexer) -> **238-247 tok/s** (q_latent); decode ~8.6-10.
- Needle-in-a-haystack at 8,939 tokens still answers "ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471" at 234 tok/s prefill.
- Per-stage (event-based, 44 MLA calls): q_proj 295ms, kv 191, idx_proj 174, kpool_write 450,
  idx_score 224, sparse 4350, o_absorb 1019. MoE is again the dominant cost (~78%): 150ms per layer
  = ~93ms slot streaming + kernel, ~56ms activation transfers across GPU0's x4 link.

## Where it stands now
Prefill is MoE/streaming bound again (the healthy place to be): ~1.7GB of expert slabs per layer per
2048-token batch at ~25GB/s = 68ms, plus the activation round trip through pinned host memory
(16MB x D2H + 32MB y H2D over the x4 card). Next candidates, in measured order:
1. Send the MoE output back as fp16 instead of fp32 (halves y's 32MB), and/or keep it on GPU1 longer.
2. `mla_sparse_decode` 99ms/layer (4.35s per batch) - audit it with the same probe method.
3. The remaining ~50ms/layer of `d2h+sync` in `moe_ffn` (sync on GPU1 then enqueue GPU0 work).


## Chunk size: bigger batches pay off, and what the scaling reveals
All at cap 262144, greedy, same prompts:
| prompt | chunk 2048 | chunk 4096 | chunk 8192 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8,316 | 238-247 tok/s | 264.2 | **280.6** |
| 31,000 | 240.0 | - | **280.3** |
A 2048-token batch needs all 288 experts of every sparse layer (1.74GB, ~70ms at 25GB/s), so a large
chunk amortises that over more tokens. Chunk 8192 is the best measured; it is now the server default.
The 32k result is the important one: going from 16 batches to 4 (i.e. 4x less expert traffic) bought
only 17%, so prefill is no longer dominated by expert streaming - the remaining cost is per-token, and
at long context it is the **indexer/scoring cost that grows with position** (every query scores all
`pos/4` pools) plus `mla_sparse_decode` over its 2052 gathered keys. Those are the next targets, and
they are algorithmic (a two-level pool selection), not a cheap kernel fix.

Deliverable impact: a 250k-token prefill now takes ~15-17 minutes instead of ~48.


## HEADLINE: full 250k-context run on the optimized engine
`./build/helios gen ~/models/glm53flash --cap 262144 --chunk 8192 --tokens 4 --prompt-file <1.3MB>`
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 4 tokens in 1449.66s  prefill 169.9 tok/s  decode 8.29 tok/s

```
- **246,193 tokens prefilled end to end in 24.2 minutes** (avg 169.9 tok/s) on a 262,144-token cache -
  the deliverable's "about 250k context" claim, measured rather than extrapolated.
- **Decode at that context: 8.29 tok/s**, i.e. the same as short-context decode: the pool-based
  sparse attention really is O(1) in context (top-512 pools are selected per query regardless of the
  246k history).
- Pool bookkeeping exercised to ~61,000 pools (capacity is 65,536) - previously the highest tested
  position was ~49,000 pools. 55.2% expert-slot residency, 240k evictions, no errors.
- Rate profile: ~230 tok/s for the first third, degrading to ~90-120 tok/s per token by the last
  batches, because the indexer scores all `pos/4` pools per query and materialises an
  `M x pos/4` score matrix. That is the dominant remaining prefill cost at long context and the
  clearest next optimization (two-level pool selection, or scoring pools in blocks with early exit).

## Deliverable checklist (current evidence)
| requirement | evidence |
|---|---|
| running inference engine | `helios serve` on 0.0.0.0:8099, OpenAI-compatible, tools + reasoning + streaming, LAN-verified |
| GLM-5.3-Flash in EXL3 | 12 shards, 85.13GB, 2.05bpw, full 45-layer + MTP model loaded from the checkpoint |
| about 250k context | 246,193-token prefill + decode at that context (above) |
| highest realistic speed | prefill 86 -> 280 tok/s (3.2x) and decode ~8-11 tok/s; per-kernel audits documented |
| correctness | KDA/MLA/MoE oracles corr 1.0000, needle-in-haystack at 8.9k tokens, greedy output parity |


## Indexer/top-k row blocking: exact, but not the long-context lever I expected
The 246k-context run degrades from ~230 to ~90-120 tok/s per token, and the indexer materialises an
`M x npools` score matrix (1GB per layer at 61k pools), so I blocked the score+topk+expand sequence
to 1024 rows to keep the working set small (same scores, same ordered top-k, so numerically exact).

Two probes were run first, and both refuted my assumptions:
- `dsa_topk` is **not** a bottleneck: 0.9ms for R=2048 x T=61000 (0.42us/row). The split kernel never
  engages because the engine passes `t_seq != 0`, and forcing it with 16-row chunks was 5x *slower*.
- The blocking is **neutral at 32k tokens**: A/B with `HELIOS_IDX_BLOCK=8192` (unblocked behaviour)
  vs 1024 gave 280.1 vs 279.9 tok/s. At 32k the score matrix is ~100MB, so the traffic reduction does
  not bite; the 1GB figure only applies near 250k context, which I did not re-measure with an A/B.
Kept because it is exact, costs nothing at short context and reduces peak memory traffic. Correctness
re-verified with the blocking active: needle-in-a-haystack at 8,939 tokens (9 blocks) still answers
"ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471", MLA oracle corr 1.0000 on all five stages.

Honest status of the long-context prefill lever: **still unidentified**. Measured and rejected this
session: expert streaming (4x traffic reduction bought 17%), top-k (0.9ms/layer), score-matrix
traffic (neutral at 32k), uncoalesced reads (fixed, they were real), and the q_latent/o_absorb launch
loops (fixed, they were real).


## Long-context growth: identified, and one fix tried (reverted)
Per-batch deltas from the new instrumentation (`[mla] batch N (pos~P): ...`, ms per batch of 11 MLA
layers at chunk 8192):
| stage | pos~0 | 8k | 16k | 24k | trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| q_proj / kv / idx_proj / kpool / o_absorb | 295 / 192 / 163 / 461 / 1015 | same | same | same | flat |
| `sparse` (mla_sparse_decode) | 4411 | 4840 | 4868 | 4895 | mild ~+10% |
| **`idx_score`** | **261** | **868** | **1468** | **2062** | **linear in pos, ~600ms per 8k tokens** |
So the long-context prefill cost is the indexer scoring: every query re-reads all `npools` pool rows.
At 4k pools that is ~8.4GB per layer at an effective ~63GB/s - latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound.

Fix attempted: a query-tiled kernel (TQ=4) that loads each pool row once and reuses it across 4
queries. It measured **7x slower** (1797ms vs 261ms for batch 1) because holding the 128-element row
in registers is 128 registers per thread - spills and collapsed occupancy. Reverted; the fast
one-query-per-block kernel is back (attn parity passes). A correct fix needs the reuse to live in
shared memory or a two-stage design (tiled dot product writing `[m*32, npools]`, then a streaming
head reduction), not more registers. The tiled kernel is kept in the source with that note.

## Cumulative performance (this session)
| metric | start | now |
|---|---|---|
| prefill (8k prompt) | 86.5 tok/s | **280 tok/s** |
| prefill (246k prompt) | ~48 min projected | **24.2 min measured** (169.9 tok/s avg) |
| decode at 250k context | - | **8.29 tok/s** (same as short context) |


## Indexer long-context cost: characterized, two fixes tried and rejected
Per-batch instrumentation (`[mla] batch N (pos~P)`) shows the growth is entirely in `idx_score`
(261 -> 868 -> 1468 -> 2062ms per batch as pos goes 0 -> 8k -> 16k -> 24k, i.e. linear, ~600ms per
8k tokens); every other MLA stage is flat and `sparse` grows only ~10%.

Two query-tiling variants were built and measured, both numerically correct (attn parity passes) and
both **slower** than the one-query-per-block kernel (261ms baseline):
- register-tiled (TQ=4, pool row in 128 registers/thread): **1797ms** - spills, collapsed occupancy.
- shared-memory-tiled (TQ=4, TP=128, dynamic smem with the opt-in attribute): **822ms**.
Both cut DRAM traffic 4x, so the kernel is **instruction-throughput-bound**, not memory-bound:
~4096 MACs per (query, pool) pair at ~4 instructions each (1 coalesced pool load, 1 smem q read,
convert, FMA), which matches the measured rate. Reverting was the right call; a real fix needs tensor
cores - a tiled dot product writing `[m*32, npools]` in blocks, then a streaming head reduction.

## Incident: source file damaged by a bad scripted edit, then recovered
A python edit used `s.replace(old, new)` where `old` had evaluated to the empty string, which inserts
`new` between every character: `src/cuda/attn/attn.cu` went from 473 lines to 24.2MB with 20,870
inserted copies. Recovered by removing every occurrence of the exact inserted block (the original
text is what remains), then restoring the `indexer_score` dispatcher that the block had contained and
deleting the two rejected variants. Verified afterwards: attn parity PASS, MLA oracle corr 1.0000 on
all stages, prefill back to 281.2 tok/s (pre-incident: 280.4), and all suites pass. Lesson recorded:
never use slice-derived `old` values without an emptiness assertion.


## Complete per-batch prefill budget (8192-token chunk, chunk wall measured directly)
`[chunk] n=8192 pos=0 wall=28081ms (291.7 tok/s this chunk)` - and the instrumented stages inside it:
| component | per batch | notes |
|---|---|---|
| **KDA layers** (34 of 45) | **6438 ms** (189 ms/layer) | flat with position; previously never instrumented |
| MLA stages (11 layers) | 6810 ms | q_proj 296, kv 193, idx_proj 164, kpool 463, idx_score 264, **sparse 4428**, o_absorb 1017 |
| MoE (45 layers) | ~6300 ms | ~93ms slots+kernel, ~56ms x/y transfers per layer |
| hc/norm/apply | ~200 ms | flat |
| **residual** | **~8400 ms** | device work outside the event windows: the shared-expert gemms (~27ms/layer ~ 1.2s), MLA `o_proj` (~55ms/layer ~ 0.6s), the f32->f16 casts and adds; the rest needs a real timeline (nsys crashed under the 73GB pinning) |

So the three biggest actionable items are now sized:
1. **KDA prefill: 6.4s/batch (22%)** - the delta-rule recurrence runs per token over the whole chunk;
   the chunked WY/state-passing formulation (exllamav3's gated_delta_net_fn, ninfer's
   prepare_wy_wu/state_passing) is the documented fix and the largest single win left.
2. **`mla_sparse_decode`: 4.4s/batch (15%)** - block per (query, head) re-gathers the same 2052 ckv rows
   for all 64 heads; a block per query with the key tile shared across heads cuts that ~64x.
3. **Indexer `idx_score`**: grows linearly with position (264 -> 2062ms per batch by pos 24k), needs the
   tensor-core two-stage design; ~19% of the 246k-token prefill total.


## Correction: the KDA layer is not gemm-bound (measured)
I assumed the 34 KDA layers' 189ms/layer was their qkv projection. The gemm benchmark says otherwise:
`kda_qkv 4096->24576` runs at **38.8 TFLOPS** at m=512 (the fastest projection in the engine - wide N
is efficient; the MLA ones are 9.7-24.8 TFLOPS), i.e. ~43ms at m=8192, only ~23% of the layer.
The rest is ~55ms for `o_proj` (8192->4096 from a 8192-wide input) plus **~90ms of conv / delta-rule
recurrence / gated norm**, which is ~11us per token at m=8192 - i.e. the sequential per-token scan.
So the chunked WY/state-passing scan would recover ~2.7s per batch (~9%), not the 22% I estimated.

Corrected ranking of remaining prefill work (per 8192-token batch, measured):
1. MoE 6.3s - of which ~68ms/layer is expert streaming (irreducible without more residency) + kernel.
2. MLA 6.8s - dominated by `mla_sparse_decode` 4.4s, which re-gathers 2052 ckv rows per (query, head)
   block 64x over; block-per-query with a shared key tile is the fix (~15% of prefill).
3. KDA 6.4s - ~3.3s projections (already at 38.8 TFLOPS, nothing to win) + ~3.1s scan (chunked scan
   would take most of it).
Also unchanged: the indexer grows linearly with position (264 -> 2062ms per batch by pos 24k) and
needs the tensor-core two-stage design.


## mla_sparse_decode is ALU/issue-bound, not memory-bound (three experiments, measured)
The kernel is 4.4s per 8192-token batch (~400ms per MLA layer) - 15% of prefill. Three hypotheses
tested and falsified, plus a standalone harness that settles it:
1. *Bytes*: K=2 (each key row load feeds two heads' dots and v-accumulators, so L2 traffic halves)
   is bit-exact vs K=1 and is **23-30% faster standalone** (2603 -> 3392 GB/s of key bytes), but
   **exactly neutral in-engine** (4425 vs 4418ms) - it needs 34KB of smem, halving occupancy.
2. *Latency*: software-pipelining the key load (fetch row i+1 while reducing row i) changed nothing
   (4429 vs 4426ms).
3. *Standalone timing* (`./test_attn_parity bench`): one full m=8192, kidx=2052 call takes 423ms,
   i.e. 0.39ns per (query,head,key) warp-iteration - the kernel completes ~108G instructions in
   236G issue slots, about 46% of peak issue. It is compute/issue-bound, near its practical limit
   for this per-key formulation.
Conclusion: real gains need an algorithmic change - tensor-core mma over a smem-staged key tile
(64 heads share one query's keys), which cuts instructions ~10x and bytes ~64x. That is the same
"two-stage" design deferred for the indexer. Harness for measuring it: `test_attn_parity bench`
prints ms and GB/s for K=1 and K=2 at two ckv footprint sizes.


## Test-suite hygiene: one unsound oracle removed, suite green again
Running the full suite this session surfaced a red test that had gone unnoticed: `test_reconstruct`
(quant diag) reported 1,572,128 failures. Diagnosis, in order:
* section [1] (pack_trellis vs the host packer, K=1..8) is bit-exact and passes.
* section [2] asserted a *hand-derived* lane-order model (`tile_slot_to_index`) and failed on 100% of
  elements for every K and codebook.
* `diff` of our `reconstruct.cu` against exllamav3's shows the kernel bodies are **identical**; only
  the torch->plain-C++ shims differ. It also shares `dq_dispatch`/`codebook.cuh` with the gemm, which
  is torch-verified (`test_gemm_smoke`) and drives the engine's layer oracles at corr 1.0000.
* A layout-independent replacement oracle (multiset of decoded values per 16x16 output tile) also
  failed 100%, so the file's assumed block<->tile correspondence is wrong as well.
So section [2] was pinning a guess, not a behaviour. It is deleted rather than re-pinned (the honest
state is "reconstruct's layout equivalence is untested" - it needs the trellis lane-layout derivation
that README_PORT.md never got). `reconstruct` is not on the inference path. Remaining sections
([1] pack round-trip, [3] had_r_128 bit-exact, [4] reconstruct_had_slice vs a double-precision H*W*H
reference, [5] inf/nan smoke) have sound oracles and now report ALL CHECKS PASSED.

Full suite state after this session's changes:
  test_attn_parity  ALL PASS (incl. new K=1 vs K=2 bit-exactness check)
  test_aux          all parity tests passed
  test_gemm_smoke   ALL OK
  test_reconstruct  ALL CHECKS PASSED (unsound section removed)
  tokenizer 28/28, chat test done
  engine: prefill 282.5 tok/s, decode 8.61 tok/s at 32k context (no regression vs 281 / 8.29@246k)


## Decode +33% (8.88 -> 11.88 tok/s): the M=1 GEMM path was the bottleneck
Decode had been stuck at ~8.9 tok/s against a 13 tok/s expert-streaming ceiling. Two one-line probes
split the per-token budget exactly (`HELIOS_LM_SKIP_MOE=1` -> 27.48 tok/s, `HELIOS_LM_SKIP_ATTN=1` ->
12.97 tok/s): **112ms/token = 75.5ms MoE + 36.4ms attention**, and the MoE is at the streaming floor
(2.07GB/token at 27GB/s = 77ms), so the whole gap was in the attention path.

Fine marks inside `kda_layer` localized it: of 23.1ms per token, **18.2ms was the five low-rank f16
projections** (b/f/g paths) - ~6.6MB of weights per layer, which should take ~7us at bandwidth but
took 535us. `glue::gemm_nt_f16` was a naive 16x16-tile gemm: at M=1 it computes a 16x16 output tile
of which 15 rows are discarded, with a scalar half->float conversion per MAC, and the engine calls it
~8 times per layer. The MLA indexer's three f16 projections had the same problem (5.6ms/token).

Fix: a real single-row GEMV (`gemv_nt_f16_k`, one warp per output, lanes splitting K so the weight
row is read coalesced at 64 halves per warp-iteration, x staged in smem), routed from `gemm_nt_f16`
when `M == 1 && !add` (switchable with `HELIOS_GEMM_RC=0` for A/B).

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| KDA lowrank (5 f16 gemms) | 18.2 ms/token | **1.4 ms** |
| MLA idx_proj (3 f16 gemms) | 5.6 ms/token | **0.5 ms** |
| KDA layer total | 23.1 ms/token | **6.6 ms** |
| attention path | 36.4 ms/token | ~14.5 ms |
| **decode @32k context** | **8.88 tok/s** | **11.88 tok/s (+33%)** |
| prefill (unchanged path) | 282.5 tok/s | 280.9-281.9 tok/s |

Verified: greedy output is token-for-token identical between the two paths on a 32k prompt
("The user has sent me a large block of text that appears..."), and prefill is unchanged because the
switch only fires at M=1. Decode is now at 91% of its streaming ceiling (was 69%).


## Full 250k-context run with the fixed decode path
`./build/helios gen ~/models/glm53flash --cap 262144 --chunk 8192 --tokens 6 --prompt-file <1.3MB>`
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 6 tokens in 1443.37s  prefill 170.7 tok/s  decode 11.08 tok/s
[slots] lookups=924160 resident=54.5% streams=243657 h2d=1436.09GB
```
- **246,193 tokens prefilled in 24.0 minutes** (170.7 tok/s avg; the previous best was 24.2 min) - no
  prefill regression from any change this session.
- **decode at 246k context: 11.08 tok/s, up from the recorded 8.29 (+34%)** - the M=1 GEMM fix is
  fully realised at the deliverable's target context, not just at 32k.

## Rejected on measurement: per-expert dense MoE at decode
`HELIOS_MOE_DENSE=1` (per-expert `exl3::gemm` + gather/scatter instead of the fused grouped kernel)
was expected to win at m=1 the way it wins at prefill shapes. Measured: decode 11.25 vs 11.88 tok/s
and prefill 252.8 vs 282.9 tok/s - **slower on both**, so the fused grouped kernel stays the default.

## Where decode time actually goes now (measured, after the fix)
112ms/token -> ~85ms/token at 32k. Components: MoE 73-76ms, attention ~14.5ms, hc/norms 0.7ms.
The MoE is ~50ms of genuine expert streaming (1.34GB/token at a 35% pool hit rate - the pool holds
3053 slabs against 12384 total, so ~75% of slabs must stream even with perfect policy; skew is
already exploited since a uniform 25% residency would imply 1.55GB) plus ~26ms of per-layer
pipeline overhead (2 D2H syncs + table build + launch, ~0.6ms/layer). A cross-token pool warm-up
does NOT happen: 120 consecutive decode tokens show flat 73-75ms/token MoE.


## Indexer: proven compute-bound (third scalar tiling measured and reverted)
The row-blocked indexer (`indexer_score_rb`, one block per 8 rows with pool keys hoisted out of the
row loop, verified **bit-exact** against the legacy kernel at npools = 256/512/700/1000) was built to
cut the pool-plane re-reads: the legacy kernel re-reads them once per (row, head), which at 246k is
~4.1TB per layer and looked like the whole 1873ms/batch. Measured in-engine: **259.8 vs 264.4ms at
pos 0, 868 vs 885 at pos 8k, 1463 vs 1483 at pos 16k, 1863 vs 1873 at pos 24k - i.e. neutral (-1%)**.
That falsifies the traffic hypothesis and pins the real one: the kernel's cost is its scalar
smem+FMA work. ~61k pools x 8 row-blocks x 256 threads x 32 heads x 128 dims of
load-smem/convert/FMA is ~5e11 ops per layer, 0.9-1.9s at 328 issue slots/cycle - which is exactly
what is measured. Only tensor cores (m16n8k16 over a shared key tile) can move this; a scalar tiling
cannot, which is now known rather than assumed (this was the third scalar attempt).
The reverted change left no dead code: kernel, wrapper, declaration and parity case all removed, and
the reason is recorded at the call site.


## Tensor-core indexer: 10.5x on the dominant long-context cost (prefill 24.0 -> 14.4 min at 246k)
The scalar indexer was proven compute-bound (a bit-exact row-blocked variant that cut pool-plane
traffic 8x changed nothing), so it was rewritten on the fp16 tensor cores:

* New kernel `indexer_score_mma_k`: block = 16 query rows x 64 pools, warp w owns pools
  [8w, 8w+8), `mma.sync.aligned.m16n8k16.row.col.f32.f16.f16.f32` over 8 dim-tiles per head, then
  `total += w[row][head] * relu(dot/sqrt(128))` accumulated in fp32 across the 32 heads. smem rows
  padded to 136 halves (an unpadded layout gave an 8-way bank conflict on both A and B).
* New pool-major mirror plane `[npools][128]` (`c_->pool_k_nt`, written by `kpool_write` alongside the
  existing `[d][p]` plane, ~17MB per MLA layer). It is exactly the column-major B operand the mma
  wants; transposing per block instead would have made every staging load a separate cache line.
* Parity: `indexer_score mma vs scalar: 0/28800 differ (max|d|=3.05e-05), mask mismatches 0` - the
  residual is fp16 rounding, and greedy output is token-identical to the scalar path.
  Two real bugs were caught by that test: a block-level visibility test writing values where the
  scalar masks -inf (fixed by publishing per (row, column)), and stale-library link failures.

| idx_score per 8192-token batch | scalar | mma | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| pos 0 | 264.4 ms | 54.5 ms | 4.8x |
| pos 8192 | 885.4 | 100.6 | 8.8x |
| pos 16384 | 1483.5 | 147.4 | 10.1x |
| pos 24576 | 1872.7 | 178.0 | 10.5x |

Full 250k-context run with it: `246193 tokens, 6 tokens in 865.04s, prefill 284.9 tok/s, decode 11.99`.
**Prefill 246,193 tokens in 14.4 minutes, down from 24.0** (170.7 -> 284.9 tok/s, +67%), and the
long-context decay is essentially gone (284.9 average vs 293 at 32k) - confirming the indexer's linear
growth was the entire decay. Across the whole optimization campaign the 250k prefill went 48 -> 14.4
minutes (3.3x) and decode at 246k went 8.29 -> 11.99 tok/s (+45%).


## Tiled fp16 NN GEMM: o_absorb 1018 -> 532ms, KDA low-rank 916 -> 180ms (prefill 284.9 -> 306.1 tok/s)
Three prefill kernels were issuing a convert+FMA per MAC through the naive 16x16-tile f16 kernel or
the scalar per-thread o_absorb kernel (1.5 TFLOPS at 8192 rows). One tiled fp16 NN GEMM
(`glue::gemm_nn_f16`: 64x64 output tile per block, 256 threads, 4x4 per thread, half2 smem staging)
replaces them, with `lda`/`ldc` strides for the head-strided views and a c_fp32 option.

| per 8192-token batch | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `o_absorb` (11 MLA layers) | 1018 ms | **532 ms** |
| KDA low-rank (5 projections x 34 layers) | 916 ms | **180 ms** |
| prefill @32k | 296.9 tok/s | **306.1 tok/s** |

`o_absorb` needed no layout change (wuv_t is already [K,N]); the KDA low-rank weights needed
transposes to [K,N], built once at init (**221 MB**, `glue::transpose_f16_half`).

Four bugs were caught by verification, in order: a missing `lda` (wrote the wrong q rows into every
output), an A-fragment read that walked k instead of rows (greedy output collapsed to "lazy lazy"),
and three in the transpose kernel - inverted fragment pairing, swapped load bounds (`x < rows &&
yy < cols` should be `x < cols && yy < rows`), and swapped grid axes. The transpose is now the
elementwise version that is correct by construction, and the bench self-test
(`[bench] transpose_f16_half 70x133 -> 133x70: 0/9310 wrong OK`) is what proved each fix: reasoning
about the tiled indexing four times was slower than writing the obvious kernel and measuring it.


## Final 250k-context numbers after the tiled-GEMM work
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 6 tokens in 829.66s   prefill 297.0 tok/s   decode 11.85 tok/s
[runner] KDA low-rank transposes built: 221.0 MB
```
**246,193 tokens prefilled in 13.8 minutes** (297.0 tok/s average), decode 11.85 tok/s at that context.
Session trajectory at the deliverable's target context:

| | start of the optimisation campaign | now |
|---|---|---|
| 250k prefill | ~48 min (86.5 tok/s) | **13.8 min (297.0 tok/s)** - 3.5x |
| decode @246k | 8.29 tok/s | **11.85 tok/s** - +43% |


## KDA prep split: 951 -> 105ms per batch (prefill 306.1 -> 315.8 tok/s)
`kda_prepare` was 75% a transposing cast written elementwise: `mqkv[ff*S + s] = qkv[s*F+ff]` writes with
stride S (8192 floats = 32KB), one memory sector per 4-byte element. Split into
`kda_transpose_cast` (smem-tiled, both sides coalesced) + `kda_gate` (the elementwise sigmoid/gate
part, already coalesced). Verified by a new bench self-test
(`[bench] kda_transpose_cast 37x70: 0/2590 wrong OK`), which is now the second such test alongside the
f16 transpose one.

| per 8192-token batch | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| KDA `prep` | 951 ms | **105 ms** |
| KDA total per layer | 4.97 ms | **4.24 ms** |
| prefill @32k | 306.1 tok/s | **315.8 tok/s** |

## IMPORTANT: the engine is not run-to-run deterministic, and how to verify it
Chasing a greedy-output difference after the prep split, I dumped KDA stage tensors from two runs with
**identical configuration** (`HELIOS_KDA_PREP2=1` twice): `qkv_in`, `mqkv`, `f_out`, `b_out`, `gate`,
`conv` all DIFFER. So the engine's own numerics vary run to run - the routed MoE's grouped kernel
accumulates with atomics, whose summation order is a function of scheduling. No expert-fallback
messages appear (0 `missing=`/`zeroed`), so it is not pool thrashing.

Consequences for verification (recorded because it invalidated a check I relied on):
* Greedy token-for-token comparison between two *processes* is NOT a valid correctness test here: a
  few tokens legitimately flip between runs. It remains useful as a coarse signal - the earlier
  "lazy lazy lazy" collapse after the missing-`lda` bug was a real defect and this check caught it.
* Deterministic evidence is: the bench self-tests (fixed inputs), the attention/aux/quant parity
  suites, and the layer oracles. Those are what a change should be gated on.


## Headline after the prep split: 250k prefill in 13.4 minutes
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 6 tokens in 804.36s   prefill 306.4 tok/s   decode 11.96 tok/s
```
**246,193 tokens prefilled in 13.4 minutes** (306.4 tok/s), decode 11.96 tok/s at that context.
Campaign totals at the deliverable's target context:

| | campaign start | now |
|---|---|---|
| 250k prefill | ~48 min (86.5 tok/s) | **13.4 min (306.4 tok/s)** - 3.6x |
| decode @246k | 8.29 tok/s | **11.96 tok/s** - +44% |

Per-8192-token batch budget now (measured by the instrumented stages, pos 0):
KDA 4.24 ms/layer x 34, MLA ~5.3 ms/layer x 11 (of which `sparse` 4.4s/batch), MoE 12.3s
(10.1s at the 2-bit trellis compute limit + 2.2s PCIe), hc/norms 0.2s.


## Quality verification at long context (through the live server, after all optimisation)
`POST /v1/chat/completions` with a 26,623-token prompt (`/tmp/needle30k.txt`, passphrase buried at the
very start of the text):
```
prompt tokens: 26623 | 84.5s | answer: 'ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471'  -> PASS
```
The engine retrieves the exact passphrase after ~26k tokens of filler, through the OpenAI-compatible
server, with all of this session's kernel changes in place. Together with the parity suites, the bench
self-tests (transpose_f16_half 0/9310, kda_transpose_cast 0/2590) and the 250k prefill/decode run,
this is the current correctness evidence. Note (see the determinism section): correctness claims must
rest on fixed-input tests like these, not on cross-process greedy text equality.


## Sparse decode: occupancy was the blocker, not the algorithm (1.52x, prefill 315.8 -> 337.2 tok/s)
The K=2 head-pair kernel (each key-row load feeds two heads) had been 23-30% faster standalone yet
exactly neutral in-engine, and I had left it disabled behind an env switch. The cause was smem, not
the math: staging the per-warp merge partials in fp32 needs 34KB against the 48KB static limit, i.e.
**one block per SM instead of two**, which cancelled the kernel's advantage. Staging them as fp16
(the merged value is written as fp16 anyway) drops it to 18KB, restoring 2 blocks/SM.

| per 8192-token batch | K=1 | K=2 (fp16 partials) |
|---|---|---|
| `sparse` stage | 4401 ms | **2904 ms** (1.52x) |
| prefill @32k | 315.8 tok/s | **337.2 tok/s** (+6.8%) |

K=2 is now the default (`HELIOS_SPARSE_K=1` selects the older kernel). The parity test was updated
from bit-exactness to a tolerance check with the reason recorded: `K=1 vs K=2 relerr 1.92e-04, 0/98304
beyond 2e-2`, and the K=2 path is also checked against the fp32 CPU reference (relerr 2.72e-04).
Lesson worth keeping: "measured neutral" deserves a second look when a *resource* limit (smem,
occupancy) sits between the kernel and the engine.

## Final 250k-context numbers
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 6 tokens in 753.37s   prefill 327.1 tok/s   decode 11.98 tok/s
```
**246,193 tokens prefilled in 12.6 minutes** (327.1 tok/s), decode 11.98 tok/s at that context.

| | campaign start | now |
|---|---|---|
| 250k prefill | ~48 min (86.5 tok/s) | **12.6 min (327.1 tok/s)** - 3.8x |
| decode @246k | 8.29 tok/s | **11.98 tok/s** - +44% |


## Where the mma sparse-decode rewrite stands (design done, fragments validated, not landed)
`mla_sparse_decode` is now the largest non-floor item: 2904ms per 8192-token batch (~12%). Its
arithmetic is 1.6 TFLOP/batch at ~2.6 TFLOPS, so tensor cores are the only remaining lever
(~4x on the stage, ~9% of prefill). I specified the kernel and validated its riskiest part rather
than starting a 3-hour rewrite with hours left in the session:

* **Fragment layouts are verified** by `src/cuda/attn/test/mma_fragment_probe.cu`
  (`0/128 wrong, max|d|=2.86e-06`), which also establishes that the scores' B operand maps directly
  onto the existing `q_lat` layout and needs no transpose.
* Design: block = one query row, 16 heads, 8 warps; per key-tile (16 keys) the scores are 64 mma
  (`m16n8k16`), the epilogue is `exp(score*scale)` with -1 keys contributing 0 (simpler than the
  scalar kernel's skip), and the output is 64 mma per warp slice. Softmax is linear, so warps can
  combine *partial* sums and partial outputs at the end - no per-tile cross-warp reduction is
  needed, only a final 8-way combine.
* **No online rescaling is required**: q and k are layer-normalized, so scores are q.k/sqrt(512) with
  |score| ~ a few units and `exp()` cannot overflow. That removes the hardest part of a flash-style
  rewrite; the parity test will confirm it numerically (tolerance, since the summation order changes).
* Remaining work: the output phase's per-tile ckv transpose (`[keys][dims]` -> `[dims][keys]`, 16KB
  through smem), the multi-warp partial-output combine, and the dispatch behind `HELIOS_SPARSE_MMA`.
  The parity harness gives a ~4s feedback loop, which is the right way to drive it.

The other sized item is the KDA `scan` (2101ms/batch): it is **latency-bound on 8192 serial steps**
(~7.6us each), not DRAM-bound - the kernel already keeps its (head, v-chunk) state slice resident - so
it needs the chunked/WY formulation (multi-token steps) rather than a bandwidth fix.


## Correction: the `kpool` stage label was wrong, and `q_latent_t` is the real cost there
`mla_layer`'s mark 4 sits after `q_latent_t`, so the segment printed as "kpool" actually contained
kpool_write + the qpos copy + q_latent_t. Adding a mark between them shows:
* **kpool_write + qpos ≈ 0.2 ms per batch** (essentially free - my earlier suspicion that its
  strided `[c][p]` stores were expensive was tested by removing them: measured exactly neutral, and
  the change was reverted).
* **`q_latent_t` ≈ 42 ms per layer** (~1.6 TFLOPS) - the actual cost in that segment, and the same
  shape class as `o_absorb` ([8192 x 512] x [512 x 256] per head).
* The debug print now reports both parts separately instead of a signed difference.

## GEMM: 8x4 register tile (5x in the bench, neutral in the engine)
`gemm_nn_f16`'s 4x4 per-thread tile spends one smem half-load per MAC, which capped it at ~2.8
TFLOPS. An 8x4 tile with vectorized B loads (128 threads) benches at **11.5-14.7 TFLOPS** at the
8192x256x512 shape and is correct within fp16 rounding (the new self-test reports
`256/32768 beyond 2e-2` from rounding-order ties, hence a tolerance check rather than bit-exactness -
the same lesson as the K=2 sparse test). Two staging loops still striding by 256 after the block
shrank to 128 threads made it wrong on every element first; the self-test caught that immediately.

**However it did not move the engine**: `o_absorb` stayed at 533ms/batch and prefill at 338 tok/s.
At the new rate its GEMM compute would be ~12ms/layer, so ~36ms/layer is something else (not the
inner loop, not bandwidth: ~780MB/layer of A+C traffic would be 0.83ms). That is the open lead, and
it is why `q_latent_t` (42ms/layer) should not be "fixed" by the same route without first explaining
`o_absorb`. The 8x4 kernel is kept because it is strictly better and verified.


## 250k confirmation after this turn's changes
```
[gen] prompt tokens=246193
[gen] 6 tokens in 752.97s   prefill 327.3 tok/s   decode 11.70 tok/s
```
Unchanged from 327.1 tok/s, as expected: the 8x4 GEMM change is neutral in-engine (measured per-stage
before and after) even though it is 4-5x faster in the bench. Standing headline: **246,193 tokens
prefilled in 12.6 minutes, decode ~11.8 tok/s at 246k context**.


## Correction: my gemm self-tests were racy, which invalidated two conclusions
Both gemm self-tests launched on the engine's non-default stream and then read back with
`cudaMemcpy`, which only orders the *default* stream - a read-after-launch race. That is why the same
kernel reported all-wrong, 256-wrong and 32572-wrong across runs, and why I wrongly concluded the 8x4
NN tile had a race of its own. With `cudaStreamSynchronize(s)` added, three consecutive runs agree:

* `gemm_nn_f16 256x128x96 vs CPU: 0/32768 (max|d|=0.00e+00) OK` - the restored 4x4/256-thread NN
  kernel is **bit-exact** against the fp32 CPU reference, so `o_absorb` and the KDA low-rank paths are
  exact, not merely within tolerance.
* `gemm_nt_f16_tiled` (B as [N,K], written for `q_latent`) is consistently wrong (16075/17600). It was
  never wired in, so it is **deleted** rather than left as dead-and-buggy code. `q_latent_t` therefore
  keeps its 42ms/layer for now; the next attempt should start from this fixed harness, and the NT
  staging (`bs[kk][n]` from `B[n][K]`) is the place to look.
* The 8x4-vs-4x4 question is settled in favour of 4x4: not because of a race, but because the 8x4 tile
  was engine-neutral and the 4x4 form is now proven bit-exact.

Lesson recorded: a self-test that reads back without synchronizing the *right* stream manufactures
flaky verdicts, and flaky verdicts cost more than the bug they hide.


## NT gemm attempt abandoned; file repaired; `q_latent_t` measured unambiguously
I retried the transposed-B gemm for `q_latent_t` by deriving it mechanically from the bit-exact NN
kernel (changing only the B staging). It failed its self-test, and the reason turned out to be
mundane and important: **`gemm_nt_f16_k` already existed** in glue2.cu as the original naive kernel
with a different signature, so my derived kernel shadowed/collided with it and the earlier verdicts
were never about the code I thought I was testing. Consequence: a botched in-place derivation left
duplicate definitions in glue2.cu; I repaired it by deleting everything from the derived kernel to the
NN wrapper (verified afterwards: exactly one of each intended definition, zero leftovers) and the
engine is healthy again - prefill 335.6 tok/s, full suite green.

Deliberate decision: **stop spending on this item.** It is worth 1.3% of prefill, has now consumed
several hours, and the remaining risk is more file surgery in the hot path. `q_latent_t` stays as is.

What the corrected instrumentation now states unambiguously (one line, no inference):
```
[mla] batch 1 (pos~0): ... kpool=0.3 idx_score=54.4 sparse=2901.8 o_absorb=537.7
                       [kpool_write+qpos=0.3 q_latent=460.3 ms]
```
`kpool_write` is free; **`q_latent_t` is 460ms per 8192-token batch (~42ms/layer, ~1.6 TFLOPS)** - the
same shape class as `o_absorb` ([8192 x 512] x [512 x 256] per head) and the obvious next bounded item
for a fresh session, now with a trustworthy self-test harness to drive it.


## q_latent_t: 460 -> 120ms per batch (3.8x) by routing, not by writing a kernel
After abandoning the NT-gemm detour I re-read the layout instead of designing around it: `w_uk[h]` is
`kv_b` rows `h*512..h*512+255`, i.e. **[K=256][N=512] row-major with N (the c index) contiguous** -
exactly what the bit-exact `gemm_nn_f16` already wants. So `q_latent` needed no transposed copy, no new
kernel and no extra VRAM: just 64 calls per layer to the tiled gemm with the right strides. The whole
NT detour was unnecessary, and checking the actual layout first would have saved it.

(latency-bound on 8192 serial steps - needs the chunked formulation). Everything else is at its floor:
MoE 12.3s (10.1s at the 2-bit trellis compute limit + 2.2s structural PCIe), `qkv` 1470ms at 38.8
TFLOPS, `o_proj` at ~25 TFLOPS.


## KDA scan: measured to be DRAM-bound on the per-token state round-trip
Two things I checked that were both wrong before being measured:
1. The kernel *does* have a per-token state-copy path (`slot_state + s * state_size`, ReplaySSM-style
   history for spec-decode rollback) behind `if constexpr (save_history)`, but the engine passes
   `channelwise=true, history=false`, which selects `save_history=false` - the in-place fast path.
   So the copy is not happening.
2. Scaling test (same prompt, different chunk sizes):
   `[kda] batch n=8192: scan=2155ms` vs `[kda] batch n=2048: scan=524.8ms` -> **0.256ms per token in
   both**, i.e. strictly linear in n: work-bound, not launch-bound.

The arithmetic then closes: the layer state is 64 heads x 128 x 128 fp32 = 4MB, read *and* written for
every token = 8MB/token/layer = 8.5us at 936GB/s, against 7.6us measured per layer per token. So the
scan is **DRAM-bandwidth-bound on the state round-trip**, and the fix is to keep the per-block slice
resident on chip instead: with V_SPLIT=4 the slice is 128 x 32 floats = 16KB per block, i.e. 32
floats/thread with 128 threads - it fits in registers, and the kernel evidently re-reads it per token
instead. That is a real kernel rewrite (6.5% of prefill), fully specified here for a fresh session.


## KDA scan: L2 persistence gives only 7%, which re-attributes the bottleneck to latency
The engine sets the persisting-L2 set-aside at init (`cudaLimitPersistingL2CacheSize`, min(attr, 64MB))
but never set a stream access policy, so it went unused. Wiring a window over the current layer's
recurrent state (4MB, hitRatio 1.0, persisting/streaming props) before the scan changes it by:

| | scan per 8192-token batch | prefill @32k |
|---|---|---|
| before | 2155 ms | 341.6 tok/s |
| with L2 window | **2000.5 ms** | **343.7 tok/s** |

Only 7% - and that is the informative part: if 8MB/token/layer of state traffic at DRAM bandwidth were
the limit, moving it into L2 would buy far more. So the scan is **latency-bound on the per-token
dependency chain** (~7.6us per layer per token = ~13K cycles), not bandwidth-bound, and my previous
"DRAM-bound" attribution was wrong. The fix is the same one, for a different reason: keep the
128x32-float slice (16KB/block, 32 floats/thread at V_SPLIT=4) resident in registers so each token's
step is a few hundred cycles instead of a global round trip. The window is kept (free, zero correctness
risk, and it does pay 7%).


## KDA scan rewrite: the exact mechanism (read from the kernel, not inferred)
The 128-dim channelwise kernel keeps the recurrent state in **global memory** (`gl_rs_r` points into
`final_state`; `rs_rd = gl_rs_r + v_start + t + bt*BTS*HEAD_DIM` with `rs_rd += HEAD_DIM` per k-row) and
makes **two full passes over it per token**:
1. a `sh_dot1` pass computing `sum(k * g * S)` into shared memory via `atomicAdd`, then `__syncthreads`;
2. the update pass reading `rs_r` and writing `rs_w` (in place for `save_history=false`), then
   `__syncthreads`.
Add the q/k two-level shuffle reductions and four-plus barriers per token and that is the measured
~13K-cycle dependency chain per token per layer (~7.6us), which is why the L2 window only bought 7%:
the bytes were never the problem, the chain is.

**The rewrite, specified**: keep the per-block slice resident on chip. With V_SPLIT=4 the slice is
`V_CHUNK_DIM(32) x HEAD_DIM(128)` floats = 16KB, i.e. 32 floats per thread at 128 threads - it fits in
registers or in one smem array, and the change is *mechanical rather than mathematical*: the state is
only touched through `rs_rd += HEAD_DIM` style pointer arithmetic, so a working copy with a 32-float
row stride (smem, 16KB) plus a load before the token loop and a store after it removes the per-token
global round trip while leaving the arithmetic identical. That is the safest form of this fix and the
one to try first; the same shape of change applies to the `sh_dot1` pass.


## BLOCKER for future aux-kernel work: the aux library does not build (pre-existing)
Trying to land the register/smem state-residency fix in `gdn.cu` I found that `src/cuda/aux` cannot be
compiled at all: `helios_shim.cuh:2: error: unterminated #ifndef`, reported once per .cu file, and it
**reproduces from a clean `cmake -B build -G Ninja`** - so it is a real preprocessor break, not a stale
build. The header itself is balanced (`#ifndef`/`#define`/`#endif` present, 397 lines), so an includer
has an unbalanced block. It dates from the port's final edits: `libaux.a` and `test_aux` were built
earlier and still pass, which is why this went unnoticed - the binaries are stale but valid.

Consequence: any change to the aux kernels is currently unbuildable and therefore unverifiable. My
gdn.cu state-residency edit was reverted rather than left in the tree uncompiled, which is the same
policy that applies to unverified kernel code everywhere else here. **Fix this first** before touching
`scan`, `conv`, `norm` or `hc_mix`; the state-residency design above is ready to drop in once it
compiles.


## KDA scan: three attributions tested and falsified - it is a serial chain, not a data problem
Each hypothesis was implemented (or probed) and measured, and none moved the scan:
1. **Per-token state write amplification** (ReplaySSM history) - not active: the engine passes
   `history=false`, selecting the in-place `save_history=false` instantiation.
2. **DRAM bandwidth on the state round-trip** - falsified by the L2 access-policy window over the
   layer's state: only 7% (2155 -> 2000ms), far too little for a bandwidth limit. (The window is kept;
   it is free and does pay 7%.)
3. **Global round-trip latency** - falsified by a verbatim 16KB smem working copy of the block's state
   slice, with unchanged addressing: 1975ms vs 1970ms, i.e. nothing.
Scaling is strictly linear in tokens (0.256ms/token at both n=8192 and n=2048), which together with
the three falsifications points at the **serial dependency chain itself**: the 128-dim kernel does two
full state passes plus four-plus barriers per token with a 256-block grid, so ~13K cycles of chain per
token per layer cannot be hidden. The only fix is to shorten the chain - process T tokens per step via
the chunked (WY/state-passing) formulation, which is a mathematical rewrite, not a memory fix. Recorded
so the next attempt does not repeat the three measurements above.

Also fixed this turn: **the aux library did not build** (pre-existing, from the port's final edits):
`helios_shim.cuh` had an unbalanced `#ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__` that swallowed the file's only `#endif`,
leaving the include guard unterminated. The guard was also wrong in intent - the two helpers it wrapped
are `__device__`-only and so need no guard, and the guard is what hid `tanh_opt` from host-pass callers
in `activation_kernels.cuh`. Removing it makes `src/cuda/aux` build cleanly again, so `test_aux` is now
a fresh compile rather than a stale binary, and aux kernels are editable again.


## nsys kernel-level budget: only ~40% of prefill wall time is kernel execution
First successful `nsys profile` of a prefill (mid_prompt, ~10k tokens = 2 chunks). Kernel totals:

| kernel | total ms | calls | avg ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| `exl3_moe_kernel<0,256,2>` | 7314 | 84 | 87 |
| `mla_sparse_dec2_k` | 2930 | 22 | 133 |
| `exl3_gemm_kernel` (4-bit projections, 5 instantiations) | 4103 | 454 | 1.5-17 |
| `cuda_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_kernel_128<0,4,1>` | 2022 | 68 | 29.7 |
| `gemm_nn_f16_k` (this session's routing: o_absorb, q_latent, KDA low-rank) | 548 | 3156 | **0.17 -> 12.6 TFLOPS** |
| `gemm_nt_f16_k` (the naive f16 kernel, still used by the MoE router and indexer projections) | 490 | 150 | 3.3 |
| `conv1d_update_kernel` | 282 | 68 | 4.1 |
| `kpool_write_k`, `layernorm_f16_k`, `dsa_topk_kernel`, `embed_gather_k`, casts | <900 combined | | |

**Total kernel time is ~9.2s per 8192-token chunk against ~22s of wall time**, so more than half the
prefill is *not* kernel execution: it is the per-layer host round trips (expert-id D2H + sync, MoE
x/y transfers, slot bookkeeping) and the expert streaming window. That reframes the remaining work:
the kernel-side items below are real but bounded, and a host-overlap effort (removing per-layer
synchronisation, deeper lookahead) now has a larger measured prize than any single kernel.

Two corrections this profile also gives:
* the tiled `gemm_nn_f16` is running at **12.6 TFLOPS** (548ms over 3156 calls, 0.17ms each), so the
  routing done earlier this session is performing as intended - the earlier "no engine benefit" reading
  was about the *stages* it replaced, not about the kernel;
* `gemm_nt_f16_k` (naive, 3.3ms avg) still costs 490ms per ~10k tokens via the MoE router and the
  indexer projections - a smaller, bounded item than I had listed (1-2% of prefill).

Kernel-side targets, confirmed by this profile: `mla_sparse_dec2_k` 2930ms (mma design in repo),
`cuda_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_kernel_128` 2022ms (serial chain), MoE 7314ms (2-bit trellis floor
plus PCIe). The profile artifact is `/tmp/scanprof.nsys-rep` (and `.sqlite`) if a further breakdown is
wanted.


## Corrected prefill budget from the profile DB: ~68% kernels, ~32% PCIe (no large host stalls)
Querying the nsys DB directly rather than reading summary tables:
* **kernels 18,799ms + memcpy 9,868ms = 28.7s**, against ~29s of wall time for that profiled run
  (mid_prompt, 2 chunks / ~10k tokens at 334 tok/s) - the budget closes, so prefill is *not* half host
  stalls. My previous ">50% is not kernel" reading was a units error: I compared a per-chunk kernel
  total against a wall time covering two unequal chunks.
* Memcpy breakdown by size bucket (copyKind 1=H2D, 2=D2H):
  | bucket | kind | calls | GB | ms |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | med (<10MB) | H2D | 14874 | 90.96 | **3991** |
  | huge | H2D | 52 | 8.32 | 2510 |
  | large (<100MB) | H2D | 180 | 7.89 | 1894 |
  | large (<100MB) | D2H | 67 | 3.38 | 1036 |
  | huge | D2H | 43 | 6.03 | 347 |
  The first row is exactly the expert-slot streaming: 14874 x 6.03MB = 89.7GB, i.e. **~48GB per
  8192-token chunk (~2.0s)**. That matches the 250k run's 1436GB/30 chunks, and 0.75 x (43 layers x 288
  experts x 6.03MB) = 56GB, so - as established earlier - the pool (3053 slots vs 12384 slabs) already
  streams near its floor; there is no warm-up gain across chunks to harvest.
* The x round trip is the second PCIe item: it leaves GPU0's VRAM over the **x4 link** (large-D2H,
  3.38GB, 1036ms = 3.3GB/s) and returns to GPU1 over x16. That ~1.3s/chunk is structural (no P2P), and
  the only lever is halving the bytes (fp8/bfloat8 x), which trades accuracy for ~2%.
So the remaining levers, by measured size per 8192-token chunk: `exl3_moe_kernel` (~3.6s, 2-bit trellis
floor), `mla_sparse_dec2_k` (~1.5s, mma design in repo), KDA scan (~1.0s, serial chain), PCIe ~4s of
which ~2s is irreducible expert streaming, and the 4-bit projections at their floors.


## Sparse decode: half2 FMA accumulation (-7.6%), and the MoE kernel is NOT at its floor
* `mla_sparse_dec2_k`'s per-key dot converted every `__hmul2` product to float (hmul2 + half22float2 +
  2 adds = ~6 ops per u). Accumulating in half2 with `__hfma2` is 4 ops per u. Parity against the CPU
  reference moved only from 2.72e-04 to **2.80e-04** (the partial sums are O(1) over 16 terms before the
  fp32 cross-lane reduction), and the stage measured **2877 -> 2657.7 ms** at 32k, prefill 345.8 -> 347.9
  tok/s. The 7.6% (not 3x) says the kernel is now dominated by the `__expf` softmax epilogue and the
  cross-lane shuffles, not the dot - so that is where any further sparse work must aim.
* Profiling arithmetic correction: `exl3_moe_kernel` = 7314ms / 84 calls = 87ms per layer, and
  8192 tokens x 8 experts x 3 matrices x 2048 x 4096 x 2 = 3.3 TFLOP per layer, i.e. **~38 TFLOPS, 54% of
  the 3090's fp16 peak** - *not* the ~17 TFLOPS "2-bit trellis floor" claimed earlier. The MoE has real
  headroom, and the trellis decode inside the kernel is the lever (the items already listed as abandoned).

## A 250k slowdown that was self-inflicted, not a regression
Two 250k runs (v7, v8) appeared 1.6-6x slow. Diagnosis sequence, each hypothesis measured:
* RAM pressure: 85/125GB used, 4GB free, kswapd active -> dropped caches; but `VmSwap: 0 kB` for the
  engine and unchanged pswpin/pswpout counters proved the arena was fully resident. Hypothesis dropped.
* GPU contention from the resident `llama-server` (1.2GB): re-ran the 32k measurement -> **345.9 tok/s,
  identical stages**, so no contention. Hypothesis dropped.
* Actual cause: the runs overlapped my own processes - v7 was launched while the previous 32k profile was
  finishing, and the 32k contention test ran concurrently with v8. The clean-run history confirms it:
  v3 753.37s, v4 752.97s, v5 742.98s, **v6 737.50s / 334.2 tok/s** - all within 2%. No regression exists;
  the headline stands at 737.50s. Lesson recorded: never launch a second engine run before the previous
  process has exited.


## Decode: persistent expert census replaces intra-run heat (+41% decode, +3.4% prefill)

Measured the problem before touching it. The slot pool is 3053 slots, and the skew probe shows the
top 25% of distinct experts (2695) covers **59%** of all requests - so ~59% residency is reachable
at this pool size. The policy was realizing **30.1%**.

Root cause, from the code: `max_pinned_` (60% of the pool = 1831 slots) was filled by *intra-run*
heat, and `evict_one` resets `heat = 0` on every eviction. Heat therefore encodes whichever phase
flooded last, and once 1831 slots were pinned by the prefill's transient hot set, decode's experts
were locked out of 60% of the pool with no way back in.

Fix - rank the pool by a **persistent, cross-run request census**:
* `<model-dir>/.helios.census`: magic `HELIOSC1`, n_layer, n_expert (288), then u32 counts per
  (layer, expert). Atomic write (`.tmp` + rename). Loaded at init, so a warm start begins with the
  right experts pinned.
* Pin/evict by census rank instead of heat. Admission stays **two-touch**: `acquire()` leaves a slot
  unpinned and a later `find()` promotes it only if the census ranks it hot, so one-off experts from a
  prefill chunk cannot consume the pinned share. Eviction prefers the lowest-ranked non-pinned slot;
  an evicted slot keeps its census score, so a valuable expert is not re-learned from zero.
* `note_request` counts **per step per active expert** (not per token), which is why prefill and decode
  contribute comparable mass (49k vs 41k requests) and one census can serve both.

One bug I introduced and then found: `end_step()` runs once per **layer** (~43x per token), so a
per-N-step schedule became a per-token cost - `recompute_hot()` sorts ~12k entries, and it was firing
~1x/token plus a census save every few tokens. Measured as ~20% prefill loss (30s/chunk vs 24.6s).
Rank refresh and census save are now throttled by wall clock (`steady_clock`, 5s / 60s).

Verified results (32k 120-token decode; and 246k prefill+decode):

| | pre-change | cold census | warm census |
|---|---|---|---|
| decode tok/s @32k | 11.40 | 16.48 | **17.45** |
| prefill tok/s @32k | 348.1 | 355.7 | 353.1 |

| 246k run | baseline | census |
|---|---|---|
| total | 737.50 s | **712.99 s** |
| prefill | 334.2 tok/s | **345.6 tok/s** |
| decode | 11.60 tok/s | **16.40 tok/s** |
| residency | 54.5% | **63.7%** |
| expert streams | 243,838 | **166,676** |
| expert H2D | 1437.15 GB | **982.37 GB** |

Quality gate: chat-templated needle at 26.6k -> `'ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471' | 77s | PASS`.
All module suites pass (attn parity, aux, gemm smoke, reconstruct, tokenizer 28/28).


## MTP speculative decoding: authoritative spec (from exllamav3, to implement)

Decode is MoE-dominated: profile of a 32k decode (30 tokens, 1010ms kernels of ~1.7s wall) shows
`exl3_moe_kernel` 545ms (54%), `exl3_gemv_kernel` 200ms, `exl3_gemm_kernel` 69ms,
`mla_sparse_dec2_k` 67ms. The MoE at M=1 moves 2.07GB (344 experts) in 18.2ms = **114GB/s and
0.95 TFLOPS** - 12% and 1.3% of the 3090's limits, i.e. latency/occupancy bound, NOT memory or
compute bound. Raising M by verifying k+1 tokens amortizes the fixed cost per weight, so MTP is the
lever. (ninfer-3090 measured 57-61% acceptance with MTP3 on a 3090.)

Spec extracted from `~/projects/exllamav3/exllamav3/architecture/glm5_next_mtp.py`,
`modules/arch_specific/qwen3_5_mtp.py` and `generator/generator.py`:

* **MTP is a plain residual block with NO mHC**, operating on the collapsed trunk state - unlike
  trunk layers 0..44. `h += MLA(attn_norm(h)); h += MoE(ffn_norm(h))`, then
  `lm_head(shared_head_norm(h))` with the **shared** lm_head.
* **target_hidden is the PRE-final-norm collapsed state**: `transformer.py` exports, for
  hyperconnection models, `x.mean(dim=2)` - the stream mean - as the collapsed hidden state. In this
  engine that is exactly `c_->xh` (the tensor `final_head` applies `final_norm` to).
* Input layer, exact order: `y = enorm(target_hidden)`, `x = hnorm(embed(token))`,
  `h = eh_proj(cat(x, y))` - **embedding first, hidden second**, [8192] -> [4096].
  Both norms use `constant_bias = 0.0`.
* Draft loop (`iterate_draftmodel_mtp_gen`): iteration 0 uses `(target_hidden, embed(last accepted
  token))`; every later iteration **self-feeds**: hidden becomes the previous MTP block output and the
  embedding is the previously drafted token. The draft layer advances its OWN KV cache by 1 per
  iteration, and the target's accepted hidden states are pushed back into it to keep layouts aligned.
* `index_share_for_mtp_iteration=True` does NOT need to be honoured: exllamav3 deliberately scores
  with the draft layer's own indexer ("self-consistent, and identical below index_topk context").
* Acceptance: greedy = argmax comparison (exact, no distributional bias) - sufficient and safest for
  v1 since it is only enabled when temperature == 0.

Rollback design (this engine): KV/indexer/pool need only `Cache::set_len()` - the caches are
position-addressed. The KDA recurrence is causal, so the KV of an accepted prefix is already correct;
only the state *after* rejected drafts is wrong. Therefore: save the KDA conv+recurrent state before
verification (8 layers x ~4.2MB = 34MB, ~40us D2D), and on partial acceptance restore it and re-run
`kda_layer` for the m accepted tokens.

Status: MTP weights are already loaded (all 288 draft experts optionally resident via
`HELIOS_MTP_EXPERTS`, off by default because 1.74GB comes out of the 3053-slot pool = ~10% less
residency). Block `input_layernorm`/`post_attention_layernorm` were missing and are now loaded.


## MTP implementation: exact remaining plan (stages A/B done and verified)

Done this session, verified:
* **A (loader)**: MTPWeights gained `input_ln`/`post_ln`; the loader now reads
  `layers.45.input_layernorm.weight` / `post_attention_layernorm.weight`, which the reference block
  needs and which the loader simply never fetched. Verified by `helios load --ram-only`:
  `LOAD OK: layers=45 moe=1 arena=73.0GB ... stride=6328512`, 256 slab pieces, 0 mismatches.
* **B (cache)**: `Cache::plan/init` take `mtp_draft` and allocate one extra MLA cache slot
  (`mtp_ord()`); `mtp_enabled()` is a `HELIOS_MTP` env switch that also gates the (already written)
  `HELIOS_MTP_EXPERTS` preload of the draft layer's 288 experts to GPU1. Verified that the default
  path is unchanged: `[cache] cap=262144 tokens mla=11 kda=34 kv=4.44GB`, all suites pass, and a
  32k gen still runs (prefill 356.6 tok/s, decode 18.54 tok/s).

Remaining, with every integration point located:
1. `mtp_block_step(h, tok, pos)`: build the synthetic `Layer` for MTP from `m_->mtp` (kind=MLA,
   moe=true, mla_ord = c_->mtp_ord(), input_ln/post_ln from MTPWeights). Per draft iteration:
   `y = rms_norm(trunk_hidden, enorm)`; `x = rms_norm(embed_gather(tok), hnorm)`;
   `xa = eh_proj(cat(x, y))` (4-bit gemm [1,4096]x[4096,8192], copy x first / y second);
   save the pre-norm copy to scratch; `rms_norm(xa, input_ln)` in place; `mla_layer(L, 1, pos)`;
   `aux::add(h, w0.attn_out16)`; `rms_norm(xf=h, post_ln)`; `ffn_layer(L, 1, pos)`;
   `aux::add(h, w0.ffn_out16)`; `rms_norm(h, shared_head_norm)`; `lm_head` -> draft logits.
   Note `mla_layer`/`moe_ffn` both read `c_->xa`/`c_->xf` as ALREADY-NORMED inputs - `layer_step`
   normalises in place with `input_ln`/`post_ln` before calling them, so the plain-residual block
   must do the same.
2. `moe_ffn` MTP branch: the draft layer's experts are resident at `m_->mtp.experts_gpu1`, so build the
   kernel's pointer table from `experts_gpu1 + e*stride` instead of the SlotMgr table. (glm53.c
   independently drops the MTP row from the routed-expert table, `rt_drop_row(c->n_layers)`.)
3. Multi-row verify head: `final_head` computes logits for the LAST row only. Verification needs the
   argmax at each of the k+1 verified positions -> a `final_head_multi(n)` variant (norms n rows,
   gemm M=n x vocab) writing fp16 logits for all rows, then a host-side argmax per row.
4. Speculation loop in `generate` (greedy only, i.e. temperature == 0; exact, no distributional bias):
   verify batch = [last_emitted, d_1..d_k]; `a` = longest prefix with `argmax(rows[i]) == d_{i+1}`;
   emit `d_1..d_a` + `argmax(rows[a])` = a+1 tokens (the bonus token is always produced, so a
   fully-rejected round still advances one token).
5. Rollback: `Cache::set_len(pos + a + 1)`, restore the KDA conv+recurrent checkpoint saved before the
   verify (8 layers x ~4.2MB, ~40us D2D), then re-run `kda_layer(L, a+1, accepted_pos)` to fix the
   state. The KDA recurrence is causal, so the accepted prefix's KV is already correct.
6. Gate: `HELIOS_MTP=1` with `--temp 0` must produce **bit-identical tokens** to `HELIOS_MTP=0`, then
   measure decode tok/s. Note enabling MTP costs ~512MB on GPU0 and ~1.74GB on GPU1 (288 pool slots,
   ~10% residency) - the trade to re-measure once drafting works.


## MTP speculative decoding: implemented and running, correctness gate still open

Code complete: a synthetic MTP `Layer` (kind=MLA, moe=true, its own cache ordinal), `mtp_step()`
(enorm/hnorm/eh_proj -> MLA -> plain residual add -> MoE on resident experts -> shared_head_norm ->
shared lm_head), `final_head_multi(n)` (logits for every verified row), the greedy speculation loop
(draft k, verify k+1 in ONE trunk forward, accept the longest agreeing prefix), and the KDA
capture/rollback (`kda_capture_begin` snapshots the conv+recurrent state and each KDA layer's input
rows; `kda_rollback` restores and replays exactly the accepted prefix). Switches: `HELIOS_MTP` (opt-in)
and `HELIOS_MTP_K` (drafts per round, default 3, 0 = loop without drafting).

Measured at 32k, 40 tokens, --temp 0:
* baseline (no MTP): 92.15s, prefill 357.0 tok/s, decode 18.29 tok/s
* MTP on: 96.07s, prefill 352.9, **decode 19.35 tok/s (+5.8%)**, rounds=25 drafts=72 accepted=14 (19.4%)
* MTP on with K=0 (loop, no drafting, no rollback): 93.22s, decode 18.63 tok/s

Two bugs found and fixed along the way: `bonus` was emitted at the end of a round *and* re-emitted as
the next round's `t0` (producing doubled text and corrupting the draft chain - that alone moved the
accept rate 16.7% -> 19.4%), and the MTP path never accumulated `tm_.decode_ms`, so it reported
0.00 tok/s.

**OPEN - not yet verified:** token-identity with the non-drafting path. My first comparison stripped
nsys-style tags from a merged log, which is unsound: stdout (token text, block-buffered) and stderr
(chunk lines, unbuffered) interleave in arbitrary order, so the recovered order is not the token
order. A clean re-test with the streams separated was attempted but the two runs aborted on OOM -
`free=1561` at start because a previous background job had restarted the user's exllamav3 server
inside the same window (the recurring self-inflicted lifecycle race; the server is running normally).
Until the equality gate passes, **MTP stays opt-in and must not be enabled by default** - the engine
is unaffected because the flag is off.

Next steps, in order:
1. Re-run the equality gate with `2>` separation: `HELIOS_MTP=1` must produce byte-identical stdout
   to `HELIOS_MTP=0` at --temp 0. Do it in a single job that owns the server lifecycle end to end.
2. **Draft-cache prefill** - almost certainly the reason the accept rate is only 19% instead of the
   57-61% seen on a 3090 elsewhere: the draft layer has its own KV cache and indexer planes, but
   nothing ever populates them over the prompt, so every draft attends over an almost empty history.
   The reference pushes the target's states through the draft model. Fix: after each prefill chunk
   (where the trunk's collapsed state for those rows is still live in `c_->xh`), run the MTP block over
   that chunk in sub-chunks of ~256 rows to fill the draft cache. Cost ~2-3% of prefill (one layer of
   42, with resident experts).
3. Only then re-measure the speed trade - including the cost of the 288 pool slots the resident draft
   experts take (pin budget 1831 -> 1659).


## MTP correctness VERIFIED (token-identical) - and the engine is not bit-reproducible run-to-run

The equality gate was the wrong instrument, twice over. Token-id tracing (`HELIOS_MTP_TOKENS`) settled it:

```
off1: 785 1196 702 3208 752 264 3460 2504 315 1467  429  7951 311  387 26532 7907 ...
off2: 785 1196 702 3208 752 264 3460 2504 315 57681 1467 8481 4244 1075 330 14999 ...
on  : 785 1196 702 3208 752 264 3460 2504 315 57681 1467 8481 4244 1075 330 14999 ...
```

* **Two identical baseline runs diverge at token 10** (same binary, same prompt, same flags). The engine
  is therefore NOT bit-reproducible across runs - almost certainly fp non-associativity in the MoE's
  per-expert accumulation order (unavoidable with the atomics-based accumulation that exllamav3 also
  uses). This is accepted practice for inference engines, but it means "HELIOS_MTP=1 must equal
  HELIOS_MTP=0 byte-for-byte" is an unachievable gate, and comparing two runs tells you nothing.
* **The MTP run matches a baseline run exactly, all 24 tokens**, including the same non-deterministic
  branch (`57681 1467 8481 ...`). So the MTP path perturbs the trunk's numerics by zero. The earlier
  "gate fails" verdict in this file was an artifact of comparing against a single baseline run *and* of
  an unsound text comparison (stdout carries loader lines and the decoded tokens are written without
  newlines, so bracketed tags from stderr cannot be stripped to recover token order).

By construction the emitted token stream is the trunk's own greedy output: every emitted token is
either `t0` (argmax of the trunk's logits), an accepted draft (equal to the trunk's argmax at that
position by the accept test), or `bonus` (the trunk's argmax). The token-id evidence above confirms it
empirically.

Quality note: the earlier "double emission" fix stands - it was a genuine bug (visible as doubled text
and a desynchronised draft chain, accept 16.7% -> 19.4%). Measured now: 24 tokens, rounds=16,
drafts=47, accepted=7 (14.9%). The accept rate remains far below the 57-61% measured on a 3090 for a
different model, and the draft-cache prefill below is the reason.

Remaining, in order:
1. **Draft-cache prefill**: the draft layer's own KV/indexer/pool planes are never populated over the
   prompt, so every draft attends an almost-empty history. Fix: after each prefill chunk (while the
   trunk's collapsed state for those rows is still live in `c_->xh`), run the MTP block over that chunk
   in sub-chunks of ~256 rows. Cost ~2-3% of prefill (one layer of 42, resident experts).
2. Re-measure the speed trade, including the 288 pool slots the resident draft experts take
   (pin budget 1831 -> 1659).
3. Then consider enabling MTP by default for temperature-0 requests (it is currently opt-in).


## MTP final state: verified correct, opt-in, modest gain - and two negative results recorded

**Draft-cache prefill: tested, no benefit, reverted.** Hypothesis was that the draft layer's own
KV/indexer/pool planes are never populated over the prompt, so every draft attends an almost-empty
history. Implemented it (embed + hnorm/enorm + interleaved concat via copy2d + eh_proj + input_ln norm
+ mla_layer only - no MoE, no head, no residual chain, which is all the cache needs; cost should have
been ~1-2% of prefill). Measured: accept 14.9% -> 10.3% (n=87, so within noise - NOT significant) and
run+load wall 207s vs ~160-200s normal, i.e. a real added cost with no demonstrated gain. Reverted
cleanly (function, call site and staging buffers all removed, zero references remain) and re-verified:
accept **22.5%** (16/71), token stream matching the `off1` non-deterministic branch, normal timing.

**Conclusion on the accept rate.** Across four MTP runs the accept rate is 14.9 / 10.3 / 22.5% with
n = 47-87 drafts each - all within ~2 sigma of each other, so the true rate is roughly 15-22% for
k=3. That is far below the 57-61% quoted for Qwen3 on a 3090, and the draft-prefill experiment did
not move it. So the low acceptance is a property of this model's MTP head (or of the draft's numerics
in a way this experiment did not reach), not of the cache being empty.

**Payoff and scope.** Measured +5.8% decode at 32k (19.35 vs 18.29 tok/s) at a 15-22% accept rate.
MTP is therefore left **opt-in** and only engages for `temperature == 0` requests (the guard also
requires rep_penalty == 1 and min_p <= 0, since any of those would make the sampler disagree with the
argmax draft test). Note the serving default is temperature 0.7, so **MTP currently gives a normally
configured server nothing** - it only speeds up greedy requests, which is what the benchmarks use.
Enabling it by default would need the sampled-acceptance rule (accept with probability
min(1, p_target/p_draft) and resample the residual on rejection), not the greedy argmax test.

Net state of the MTP feature: implemented (~450 lines), **correctness verified token-identical**,
opt-in, +5.8% on greedy decode. The honest summary is that speculative decoding is a much smaller
lever on this model than the profile suggested it would be, because the MoE's M=1 inefficiency is real
(114GB/s, 0.95 TFLOPS) but the drafts simply are not good enough to exploit it.


## FINAL VERIFICATION (current binary, all work above included)

```
250k prefill+decode : 6 tokens in 711.60s - prefill 346.3 tok/s, decode 17.82 tok/s
needle @26.6k       : 'ZEPHYR-QUARTZ-4471' | 78s | PASS   (chat-templated, via helios serve)
suites              : attn parity PASS, aux PASS, gemm smoke OK, reconstruct OK, tokenizer 28/28
slots               : census hot set 1831/13248, pool 3053 slots x 6.035MB = 17.99GB
```
Re-run specifically because the MTP work touched `moe_ffn` after the previous headline was taken; the
`is_mtp` branch is inert when `HELIOS_MTP` is unset (`experts_gpu1 == nullptr`), and the numbers
confirm it: 711.60s vs 712.99s before, prefill 346.3 vs 345.6, decode 17.82 vs 16.40 (the decode gain
is the census still accumulating requests - 1,167,221 in the file now).

## Deliverable audit

| deliverable | evidence |
|---|---|
| Running engine for GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 | `helios` (C++/CUDA), loads the full 85.13GB / 12 shards, `gen` + OpenAI-compatible `serve` |
| ~250k context | 246,193 tokens at cap 262,144 |
| Highest realistic speed | prefill 86.5 -> **346.3 tok/s** (4.0x), decode @246k 8.29 -> **17.82 tok/s** (2.1x) |
| Custom CUDA kernels | `mla_sparse_dec2_k`, the KDA recurrent kernel, tensor-core indexer (`indexer_score_mma_k`), tiled fp16 GEMMs, mHC kernels, plus the ported EXL3 quant core - each with a parity test |
| Tiered streaming + expert ranking | 73GB pinned RAM arena -> GPU1 slot pool, persistent census-ranked residency (+41% decode), PCIe-aware GPU placement, L2 persistence |
| KV compression | 512-wide absorbed MLA latent (fp16), ~72x smaller than unabsorbed per-head K+V |
| Cloud smoke test | NOT performable here: no API credentials or LLM CLIs in this environment (checked `env`, `~/.config`, PATH; api.openai.com returns 401 unauthenticated). This is the user's "second step" per the objective. |

Remaining optimisation levers, all measured and characterised (none required by the deliverable):
`exl3_moe_kernel` ~3.6s per 8192-token chunk at 38 TFLOPS (54% of fp16 peak) - trellis decode bound;
`mla_sparse_dec2_k` ~1.4s, now epilogue/shuffle bound after the half2-FMA change; the KDA scan ~1.0s
(serial chain); ~4s of PCIe of which ~2s is irreducible expert streaming. MTP is implemented and
verified but opt-in for the reasons recorded above.

## Open issues

1. **`exl3_moe_kernel`** - the largest remaining lever, and the numbers are now measured rather than
   estimated: ~3.6 s per 8192-token chunk (the single biggest kernel), running at **38 TFLOPS, i.e.
   54% of the 3090's fp16 peak**, while moving expert weights at only ~114 GB/s. At M=1 (decode) it is
   neither memory- nor compute-bound but latency/occupancy-bound. The lever is the trellis decode
   inside the kernel (per-expert barriers, ticket scheduler, edge handling).
2. **`mla_sparse_dec2_k`** ~1.4 s per chunk. After the half2-FMA dot change (which removed 7.6% of the
   stage) it is now bound by the `__expf` softmax epilogue and the cross-lane shuffles - that is where
   any further work must aim.
3. **KDA scan** ~1.0 s per chunk, bounded by the serial recurrence. A chunked formulation is designed
   but not implemented.
4. **Layer-major prefill, multi-chunk inner loop** still trips an illegal access. It stays behind
   `HELIOS_LAYER_MAJOR=1`; single-chunk layer-major works and has no theoretical advantage over one
   large chunk, so this is low priority.
5. **MTP speculative decoding is IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED** (`HELIOS_MTP=1`), contrary to the older
   note further down: correctness confirmed token-identical to the non-drafting path via token-id
   tracing, and it gives +5.8% decode on greedy requests. It remains **opt-in** because (a) the
   accept rate is only ~15-22% for k=3, so the win is small, and (b) it only engages at
   `temperature == 0` - a normally configured server (temperature 0.7) gets nothing from it.
   If pursued further: implement the sampled-acceptance rule (accept with probability
   `min(1, p_target/p_draft)`, resample the residual on rejection) so it works at temperature > 0;
   and audit the draft's numerics against a torch oracle, since a draft-cache prefill experiment
   (aimed at the low accept rate) showed no benefit and was reverted.
6. **The engine is not bit-reproducible run-to-run** (two identical baseline runs diverge around
   token 10), almost certainly fp non-associativity in the MoE's accumulation order. Any A/B
   comparison must use token-id tracing and allow for this, not assume two runs are comparable.

## Constraints discovered (not fixable in software)
- No P2P: `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` returns 0 both directions (GPU0 0000:07:00.0 x4, GPU1
  0000:2b:00.0 x16), so the expert pool must live wholly on GPU1 and every cross-card activation
  bounces through pinned host memory.
- GPU0's link is x4 (~2.85GB/s measured), GPU1's is x16 (~25.16GB/s measured): the pool placement on
  GPU1 is load-bearing.

## Tool calls on the OpenAI surface: three defects found and fixed (2026-09-19)

Reported from a Hermes CLI session against `helios serve`: tool calls arrived malformed, and the
engine stayed busy on both GPUs after the client was killed. Both reproduced offline; neither was a
model problem.

**The CLI's own log narrowed it immediately.** `api_calls=1/200 tool_turns=0`, `history=0`: everything
observed came from *one* cold first turn, so no history round trip was involved, and the visible
garbage (commands mutating between frames, `</arg_value>`, `</think>`, `<tool_call>` as literal text)
was a single streamed response.

**Defect 1 - `<|observation|>` in model output did not end the turn.** The template writes
`<|observation|>` *before* tool responses, so a model that emits it has run past the end of its turn
and is inventing the observation it is owed. The parser dropped the token and kept going, so the
hallucinated tool response became visible *content* and the hallucinated *second* tool call was parsed
and handed to the client as a real call - carrying whatever the model had scribbled, e.g.
`command = "ps -eo ppend,etime..."`. That is the reported "malformed tool call", and it compounds: the
client runs a fabricated call, feeds a bogus result back, and the next turn is worse. `<|endoftext|>`
and `<|end|>` were dropped the same way. All three now terminate generation exactly like `<|user|>`,
and the parser latches at a boundary so nothing after it is parsed even if the caller keeps feeding.
Pinned for every chunking (1..64 bytes) against the non-streaming parse.

**Defect 2 - tool call ids collided.** `drain()` numbered calls `call_<n>`, but the streaming path took
the id from `out.tool_calls`, which is only filled *after* generation: every streamed call was
`call_0`. Two calls in one turn thus reached the client with the same id, and the template's
id-matching round trip pairs results with the wrong call. `finish()` additionally hardcoded `call_0`
for an unterminated final call. The id now travels in the Delta and both paths number from one
counter.

**Defect 3 - a disconnected client did not cancel its generation.** The header comment claimed it did;
the emit callback was `void`, so the runner could never be told. `alive` only suppressed further sends
while the engine decoded the rest of the budget - the "burning hot after I exited the CLI" symptom.
The callback returns bool now and the token loop stops on false. Measured: kill the client at
`decode_tokens=325`; it reads 327 at +4s and 327 at +19s (before, it would have run to `max_tokens`
at ~11 tok/s).

**Plus a latent template divergence.** `render_chat` stripped `strict` from tool schemas but not
`defer_loading`, where the reference `tool_to_json` skips both. Hermes sends neither, so it was
invisible - but the renderer's contract is byte-equality with the checkpoint's template, so it is fixed
and covered.

**Verification.** `test/chat_parity.py` is new (the harness `test_chat.cpp` referred to had gone
missing): it re-renders CASE1-CASE4 from the checkpoint's own `chat_template.jinja` through
transformers and diffs them against `build/helios_chat_test` - 4/4 identical. `test_chat.cpp` pins the
parser contract (turn boundary, chunking invariance, id uniqueness). End-to-end on the user's own
failing prompt with one `terminal` tool: single call, `id=call_0`,
`arguments={"command":"ps aux | grep -i python | grep -v grep"}`, valid JSON, `finish_reason=tool_calls`,
zero markup leakage into content or reasoning. A dead and malformed `kThinkEndAlt` constant (nothing in
the checkpoint mentions that marker) was removed.

## Expert-slot crash: residents were evictable mid-step (fixed, with an A/B)

Reported: `helios serve` died mid-session with `[moe] L3 n=412 UNRESOLVABLE missing=1 first=34` after
`missing=3 forced=3`, on a `chunk n=412 pos=29532` - a prefix-reused request (the multi-turn chat
shape).

**The log contradicted itself, and that was the clue.** For the expert the crash named, `diag_expert`
printed `map->slot 1760: layer=3 expert=34 busy=1 pinned=0` plus `in_slots=1 in_used=1 mapped=1` -
resident, mapped and in use - while the resolution loop called it missing. Two defects:

**1. `find()` does not reserve.** The acquire loop called `acquire()` only for experts *absent* from
the pool; experts already resident were merely `find()`-ed, and `find()` never adds a slot to `used_`.
Only `used_`/`busy` protects a slot, so residents stayed fully evictable. With the pool near-full
(1831 pinned + residents out of 3053 slots) every `acquire()` evicts to make room - so the loop evicted
experts the same chunk was about to read. The `missing` count was therefore not a shortage: the loop
was destroying its own working set. Forcing then evicted one more, which is why the re-count still found
1 missing and execution reached `abort()`.

**2. The stale `first` made the crash log useless.** `first` was set in the first pass and never
updated, so `UNRESOLVABLE` named an expert that had already been fixed - exactly the contradiction
above. The re-count now reports the expert that is actually still missing, and the line carries
`still_missing=`.

**Also fixed:** the force/degrade pass ran *after* the pointer tables had been built and copied to the
device, so a force-fit could not affect the tables it was meant to protect, and the "graceful
degradation" the comment promised (zero slab instead of a null entry) could never happen. The pass now
runs before the tables, and a genuinely unresolvable expert is served from the zero slab with a loud
`DEGRADED` line instead of aborting the server. Those tokens get a wrong MoE contribution - that is the
honest cost - but one bad expert no longer takes the process down.

**A/B on identical workload and (warm) census** - 2 requests, 22.7k-token prompt, `reserve()` the only
difference:

| build | `[moe]` resolution events |
|---|---|
| `reserve()` removed (pre-fix behaviour) | `missing=2`, then `missing=1` x4 - **5 events** |
| `reserve()` in place | **none**, both requests completed |

That isolates the missing reservation as the cause rather than a coincidence of pool state.

Side observation from the same runs: with prefix reuse working, the second turn reuses 22,748 tokens
(`prefix_last_resume`, 3s instead of 97s); the runs that showed no reuse were the first ones in a fresh
process, before any snapshot at the resume point existed.
